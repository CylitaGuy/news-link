Environment Canada said flurries paired with dropping temperatures could be expected Monday with northerly winds of 30 km/h and gusts to about 50 km/h. Temperatures are likely to fall to about –8 C Monday afternoon, with a wind chill making it feel like –16.  At midafternoon Monday, the province's road conditions map showed partly covered roads in Charlottetown and the main roads in and out, as far as Crapaud, Morell, Wood Islands and almost to Kensington. Route 315 from Wood Islands to Montague was also partly covered. CBC meteorologist Jay Scotland said no significant snowfall is expected Monday, but the brisk winds could mean blowing snow on exposed roads.  Temperatures will also continue to fall tonight ahead of a fairly sunny but bitterly cold Tuesday, he said.

1,Anonymous,2020-01-17T21:53:16.952Z,"Forestry professor was fired for harassment and discrimination, college says","A biologist teaching at the Maritime College of Forest Technology was fired for harassing his students and colleagues, making sexist and discriminatory comments and undermining his colleagues' authority, according to court documents filed by his former employer. Rod Cumberland, who's now a People's Alliance Party candidate for the Saint-Croix byelection, was terminated from his teaching position at the college on June 20, 2019. Cumberland filed a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against the Maritime College of Forest Technology on Nov. 18, 2019, saying he was fired for expressing his views on the forest industry's use of the herbicide glyphosate.  But a statement of defence from the college, filed Jan. 7, says Cumberland was fired for other reasons, including:  Making disparaging remarks about the college. Bullying, harassing and belittling his students. Setting the clock ahead and preventing students who arrived late to enter the classroom. Making inappropriate, offensive, sexist and discriminatory comments. The college's response to Cumberland's lawsuit says he used the terms ""faggy"" and ""fruity"" to describe students in the class.  Cumberland denies those allegations in his lawsuit. He says the college did not properly investigate the workplace misconduct allegations against him.  ""If it did, the investigation did not meet the most basic standard of procedural fairness,"" Cumberland's lawsuit says. Cumberland's lawyer said many of the school's allegations are new and were never listed as reasons for his dismissal. ""A lot of these allegations against Mr. Cumberland in our view are completely false and slanderous and have never been raised with Mr. Cumberland at all,"" said Paul Champ, representing Cumberland. ""They're not even referred to in his letter of termination."" Champ argues that because it is the first time those allegations have been brought forward by the school they indicate to him that they were not the reason for Cumberland's firing. The forestry school's response to the lawsuit alleges Cumberland began to harass and undermine Gareth Davies, who was appointed to the academic chair position in October 2018, by ""constantly questioning his policies, decisions and teaching abilities.""  The college alleges Cumberland harassed Davies because he was upset that Davies got the academic chair job over him.  ""The plaintiff began a campaign of undermining the authority of Davies by sending his 'concerns' and questioning decisions via email to the entire faculty."" The defence says the emails were ""abusive, accusatory and unnecessarily judgmental."" It also alleges Cumberland confiscated his students' personal items, forcefully removed their hats and singled them out in front of the class.  Some of the comments the employer claims Cumberland made in class include comparing abortion to killing animals for management, and saying road-kill meat that's unsafe for human consumption should be given to soup kitchens to ""'solve the problem.'"" The college says Cumberland's views on glyphosate were not raised at his termination meeting in June. ""This is a narrative perpetuated by the plaintiff to avoid responsibility for his offensive and inappropriate behaviour while working for the defendant,"" say the court documents. After being told to leave campus immediately once the meeting was over, the college says ""the plaintiff did not comply and instead commenced driving around the forestry complex erratically.""  Neither the college's nor Cumberland's claims have been tested in court.  Cumberland is seeking $115,442.73 in damages, which he says is equivalent to 14 months reasonable notice of his dismissal. He is also asking for punitive damages, a declaration that his charter rights were violated and to be reinstated as a professor at the college. Cumberland's lawsuit was filed by Paul Champ of Champ Associates in Ottawa. David W. McMath of McMath law firm in Fredericton is signed on to the document as well.  The college is represented by Stewart McKelvey law firm in Fredericton. A court date has not been set. Cumberland began working for the college as a forest operations supervisor in June 2012.

Prosecutors charged 34-year-old Seth Lookhart with felony Medicaid fraud and reckless endangerment. A former patient testified Wednesday at his trial that she was angered when an investigator showed her an unauthorized 2016 video of Lookhart extracting one of her teeth while she was sedated and he was riding the hoverboard Veronica Wilhelm was ""pretty livid"" about the dentist's actions, she testified. ""When did Dr. Lookhart get your approval to take out your tooth on a hoverboard,"" prosecutor Joan Wilson asked in court. ""He never did. I obviously wouldn't have approved that. That's dangerous,"" Wilhelm said. Wilhelm also was angered that Lookhart sedated her son for a teeth cleaning, she said. Lookhart denied the felony fraud allegations but acknowledged some other accusations, including the hoverboard procedure, defense attorney Paul Stockler said. Stockler described the dentist's actions as ""absolutely stupid."" ""But I've seen much more dangerous things where no doctor has been charged,"" the lawyer said. The Anchorage dentist unnecessarily sedated patients so he could inflate his Medicaid billing, authorities said. Lookhart fraudulently billed Medicaid about $1.8 million dollars and stole $250,000 from his partners, authorities said. A state board suspended Lookhart's dentistry license in 2017. Wilhelm addressed Lookhart directly in court. ""I don't have anything bad to say about taking out my tooth, I appreciate that, but I just think that what you did was outrageous, narcissistic, you know, and crazy,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alaska-dentist-hoverboard-1.5389424,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/stanton-health-authority-lawsuit-1.4561675,/news/canada/north/stanton-health-authority-lawsuit-1.4561675
3,Zulekha Nathoo,2020-01-18T23:09:29.618Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan will give up royal titles, public funding","Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer be working members of the Royal Family and will, therefore, no longer use their royal titles or taxpayer money, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace released Saturday. ""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments,"" the statement reads. ""They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties."" The changes will take place in the spring. The decision follows weeks of uncertainty and hastily called family meetings after the couple announced they would be stepping back from their senior roles within the Royal Family and spending more time in North America. In a surprising Instagram message posted at the beginning of 2020, the pair called the move ""a progressive new role within this institution"" and expressed a desire to become financially independent. In line with that objective, the Sussexes intend to repay costs for the controversial refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, according to Saturday's palace statement. It will remain the couple's U.K. residence. The historic home, which is located just south of Windsor Castle and offers more privacy, was the subject of scrutiny last year. Media reports revealed renovations to the building — which cost an estimated £2.4 million ($4 million Cdn)  — were coming from the Sovereign Grant, the monarchy's taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. Q&A | Watch as royal commentator Katie Nicholl discusses Harry and Meghan coming to Canada: Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their Christmas holidays in B.C. and are planning to live in Canada part time. The couple has battled intense media attention since their relationship became public in 2016. The coverage has continued after the birth of their son, Archie. In a British documentary released last year after becoming parents, Markle didn't hide the fact that living under a microscope was a struggle and has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,"" she told ITV reporter Tom Bradby. It remains unclear whether the Canadian government will cover security costs for the couple. Buckingham Palace won't comment on details of those arrangements, but says there are ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" In an unusually personal message added to the Palace statement, the Queen said she is ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" ""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" said the Queen. ""It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.""

4,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-15T16:17:03.386Z,Pesticide on planes: Parents call for changes after cabin fumigated with passengers on board,"Rania Khunaysir didn't see it coming when she booked a last-minute Caribbean vacation for her young family. The Toronto parent had no idea the airplane cabin would be fumigated with them on board just before they landed in Jamaica, despite guidelines that say passengers should be clearly and repeatedly informed of the requirement before they fly.  ""Suddenly there was an announcement on the intercom saying that [flight attendants will] be walking down the aisle spraying a non-toxic insecticide ... I thought insecticide doesn't sound non-toxic,"" Khunaysir told Go Public about the family's flight last August. Khunaysir's husband Randy Beharry and their three-year-old daughter are both asthmatic. The couple's son, who was seven months old at the time, was also on the flight. ""I was worried about my kids."" Beharry said. ""My asthma triggered probably within minutes. I had a hard time breathing,"" The experience left the family concerned about potential health impacts of the spray and calling for strict rules that require passengers to be clearly informed before they fly. ""I don't want to be inhaling this pesticide,"" Khunaysir said.  More than two dozen countries, such as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, require airlines to spray insecticides on flights that arrive from Canada. The process is meant to kill insects that could spread disease. The World Health Organization has said it has found no evidence the sprays used are harmful to human health when they are used as recommended, but also says non-chemical methods need to be found.   The long-standing practice is raising concerns among some health experts. ""There is no such thing as a non-toxic pesticide,"" said researcher Chris van Netten, a professor emeritus with the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health. He calls the widespread system of spraying pesticides ""not acceptable"" and said airline crew members and passengers need to be better informed and protected — especially children, older travellers and those with respiratory problems.  Frequent traveller Josie Ball from Selkirk, Ont., flies to Cuba several times a year with Sunwing and said she was shocked the first time she was on a flight where the cabin was sprayed.  She said people on her flight in April 2018 were coughing and wheezing.  ""I think the public should have been aware ... that there is a spraying in these countries … and [told] a little bit more about the chemical they're spraying,"" she said. She now takes her own mask when she's travelling to hotter countries.  Harlene Hart from Newington, southeast of Ottawa, was on her way to Cuba on another Sunwing flight in February, a birthday present from her boyfriend, when the cabin was sprayed with pesticide about an hour before they landed.  ""Insecticide should be sprayed in a well-ventilated area,"" she told Go Public in an email. ""Not a sardine can with partially reused air."" What upsets her most, she said, is that she wasn't clearly notified before she purchased her ticket. She said she wouldn't have taken the trip if she had known. Canadian airlines are not obligated to let passengers know before they fly that the cabin will be sprayed with insecticide — despite studies cited by health experts Go Public spoke with who say the spraying can cause serious asthma attacks, skin irritations and long-term problems with the nervous system. Transport Canada said there's nothing it can do, but the transportation authority does acknowledge the practice could pose a ""foreseeable hazard.""  The video below was posted by YouTube user ScottTheCoffeeGeek. It is unverified, but appears to show a flight attendant on a China Eastern flight carrying out the ""top-of-descent"" disinsection procedure, which involves spraying while passengers are on board.  Go Public found an advisory issued in 2009 where the department said passengers with respiratory issues need to be clearly informed before they fly so they can get ""advice from their own physician ... on whether they should travel to those destinations."" That advisory sets guidelines — not rules — saying airlines should notify passengers: • Before they purchase their tickets. • On the flight ticket itself. • Before boarding the aircraft. None of the four Canadian airlines that travel to these destinations informs passengers using all three methods.  WestJet points out that disinsection is only required on four of the 20 countries it flies to, and two other airlines that fly to these countries — Sunwing and Air Transat — say they are complying with guidelines by putting the information on their websites and telling passengers who ask. Air Canada also requires passengers booking online to click on a box agreeing to the airline's ""General Conditions of Carriage."" Halfway through that document there is information about the spraying being carried out on certain routes.  The airline also mentions aircraft disinfection on its ""Health Tips"" section of the website and provides a link to that section on the itinerary emailed to passengers who book directly with Air Canada.  However, passengers won't see that link if they book through third party websites like Khunaysir did when she booked her Air Canada flight. Van Netten, who has studied the effects of repeated exposure to pesticides, said the message that insecticide will be used in plane cabins isn't getting through. He said airlines and Transport Canada can do better. ""People have a right to know what they are going to be exposed to.""  The practice of fumigating an airplane's cabin started decades ago. It's mandated by governments outside Canada and considered necessary to control potentially deadly diseases that can be transmitted via insects — such as malaria and yellow fever — before entering certain tropical countries.  Twenty-seven countries require Canadian airlines to spray. Two methods are used, according to the Transport Canada website: spraying aerosol insecticides in the cabin while passengers are onboard and treating the airplane's interior surfaces before passengers board. ""Both of them have their problems,"" van Netten said.  He said the second method leaves toxic residue on surfaces travellers eat and sleep on, noting recent studies have drawn a link between both methods of spraying and effects on the nervous system. ""Tingling in the fingers for instance — that's how it would start. And it can go all the way up to a neurological impairment ... but that takes a lot of exposure to get to that stage."" The spray often contains an insecticide called Permethrin, a pesticide that's been approved by the World Health Organization for what's called ""disinsection"" on flights.  The union representing flight attendants in Canada is also worried about the spraying.  ""We get reports of a sore throat, sore eyes … lots of skin conditions,"" said Troy Winters, senior health and safety officer for the Canadian Union of Public Employees. ""I've got a recent report about skin peeling off of the inside of somebody's hand and we had one fairly serious asthma reaction.""   He's concerned about the long-term effects of repeated exposure on airline staff, saying some can be exposed to the spray more than 100 times during their career. ""Recently I've started to see some reports of potential longer-term results and I'm concerned about potential long-term neurological effects.""  There are no industry-wide rules on what, if any, protective gear flight attendants wear while fumigating.  All the airlines say they provide training and safety equipment to staff. Winters would like to see the Canadian government put pressure on the destination countries to reduce the use, suggesting a review of whether a flight leaving Canada in the dead of winter really needs to be fumigated.  The U.S. has a law that requires airlines to disclose disinsection on their website and refer travellers to the specific section when they buy a ticket.  The Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization Act also recommends the U.S. government work with WHO to find a ""safe, effective, and nontoxic means of preventing the transportation of disease-carrying mosquitoes and other insects on commercial aircraft."" There are non-spraying methods being developed, like a mechanical air curtain that blows everything out in one direction, but they are still in the testing stages.  WHO says the chemicals used pose no risk to human health when used properly, but when it reviewed current disinsection practices in 2018, it said there is a need for new ""nonchemical"" methods. For now, travellers have few options — such as choosing to travel to countries that don't require spraying, travelling with a mask to put on before the spraying starts and being sure to wipe down all surfaces on the plane when passengers settle in. Khunaysir and Beharry say given the age of their children and asthma issues, they would have chosen another destination if they were told ahead of them that they'd be sprayed.  ""I'm really surprised that they allow this to continue,"" Khunaysir said. ""I would've had no problem saying, 'Let's change our destination, let's go somewhere else, where they don't require that.'""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

The company says the miss is mainly due to actions taken to resolve challenging rail projects, the timing of milestone payments and new orders and the delivery of four business jets slipping into the first quarter of 2020. The stock was down 57 cents at $1.22 in early trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and closed at $1.39.

It's the third restriction issued by the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board related to safety aboard the Terra Nova, about 350 kilometres off the coast of Newfoundland, in just over a month. The provincial oil and gas regulatory board has also ordered that all confined-space work policies and procedures be reviewed by Suncor and updated for compliance with regulatory requirements. The measures are to ensure worker safety, said a release from the C-NLOPB. On Dec. 19, Suncor was told to stop production due to defective redundant fire-water pumps on the Terra Nova. Less than two weeks later, on Dec. 29, a worker aboard the Terra Nova fell from a ladder inside a tank while conducting gas testing aboard the Terra Nova. The employee was flown to hospital after suffering what the board called sustained ""non-life-threatening injuries."" As Suncor submitted its review of the incident, the C-NLOPB ordered the company to implement a fall protection system for all ladders above six metres. The board's most recent order, issued Saturday, comes following the completion of its own review of the incident, and the C-NLOPB has started an inquiry. All issued orders will remain in effect until its completion.  At that time, the C-NLOPB will also determine if additional enforcement action is warranted. ""Our investigation into the incident is ongoing. Once the investigation is complete, learnings will be evaluated and appropriate actions will be implemented. Our first priority is always the safety of our team and we're committed to taking necessary actions to keep them safe,"" a Suncor spokesperson said in an email to CBC on Monday evening.

7,Anonymous,2020-01-15T20:13:53.817Z,Earth just had its hottest decade on record,"The decade that just ended was by far the hottest ever measured on Earth, capped off by the second warmest year on record, two U.S. agencies reported Wednesday. And scientists say they see no end to the way man-made climate change keeps shattering records. ""If you think you've heard this story before — you haven't seen anything yet,"" Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said at the close of a decade plagued by raging wildfires, melting ice and extreme weather that researchers have repeatedly tied to human activity. ""This is real. This is happening."" The 2010s averaged 14.7 C worldwide, or 0.8 C higher than the 20th-century average and more than one-fifth of a degree C warmer than the previous decade, which had been the hottest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The decade had eight of the 10 hottest years on record. The only other years in the top 10 were 2005 and 1998. NASA and NOAA also calculated that 2019 was the second hottest year in the 140 years of record-keeping. Five other global teams of monitoring scientists agreed, based on temperature readings taken on Earth's surface, while various satellite-based measurements said it was anywhere from the hottest year on record to the third hottest. Several scientists said the coming years will be even hotter, which would knock these years out of the record books. ""This is going to be part of what we see every year until we stabilize greenhouse gases"" from the burning of coal, oil and gas, Schmidt said. LIVE: NASA and <a href=""https://twitter.com/NOAA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NOAA</a> climate experts discuss the annual global temperatures analysis for 2019 in a teleconference: <a href=""https://t.co/PWJkcuQ2Jt"">https://t.co/PWJkcuQ2Jt</a><br>Earth's global surface temperatures in 2019 were the second warmest since modern recordkeeping began in 1880: <a href=""https://t.co/ZRrydb1PiR"">https://t.co/ZRrydb1PiR</a> <a href=""https://t.co/aA4kbtaWJU"">pic.twitter.com/aA4kbtaWJU</a> ""It's sobering to think that we might be breaking global temperature records in quick succession — 2020 is off to a horrifying climate start, and I fear what the rest of the year will bring to our doorsteps,"" said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb. NASA's Schmidt said that overall, Earth is now about 1.2 degrees C hotter since the beginning of the industrial age, a number that is important because in 2015, global leaders adopted a goal of preventing 1.5 C of warming since the rise of big industry in the mid- to late 1800s. He said that shows the global goal can't be achieved. (NOAA and the World Meteorological Organization put the warming since the dawn of industry slightly lower.) ""We have strong human-induced global warming,"" said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. ""What we observe here is exactly what our physical understanding tells us to expect and there is no other explanation."" Other explanations that rely on natural causes — extra heat from the sun, more reflection of sunlight because of volcanic particles in atmosphere and just random climate variations — ""are all much too small to explain the long-term trend,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist. Scientists said the the decade-long data is more telling than the year-to-year measurements, where natural variations such as El Niño, the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean, come into play. ""Human-caused climate change is responsible for the long-term warming — it's responsible for why the 2010s were warmer than 2000s, which were warmer than the 1990s, etc.,"" Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler said in an email. ""But humans are not responsible for why 2016 was warmer than 2015, or why 2019 was warmer than 2018."" NOAA said the average global temperature in 2019 was 14.85 C, or just a few hundredths of a degree behind 2016, when the world got extra heat from El Niño. That's 0.95 C higher than the 20th century average and 1.16 C warmer than the late 19th century. Parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America had record-high temperatures in 2019, as did Alaska, New Zealand and New Mexico, NOAA said. Alaska was 3.4 degrees warmer than average, at 0.11 C. It was the first time in recorded history that Alaska's average annual temperature was above freezing. The United States, which had only its 34th warmest year, was nevertheless hit by 14 weather disasters that caused $1 billion US or more in damage last year, according to NOAA. Globally, the past five years have been the hottest five on record, nearly 0.9 C warmer than the 20th century average, according to NOAA. The last year Earth was cooler than the 20th century average was 1976, before Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, French President Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump Jr. were born. If you want to know what this means for people and the world, just look at wildfire-stricken Australia, Schmidt and others said. Global warming is already being seen in heat waves, ice sheet melt, more wildfires, stronger storms, flood-inducing downpours and accelerating sea level rise, said Hans-Otto Portner, who heads the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change team that looks at the impact of climate change. Sea ice both in the Arctic and Antarctic reached their second-lowest levels in 40 years of monitoring, NOAA reported. Dr. Renee Salas, a Boston emergency room physician and Harvard professor who studies climate change's effects on health, said ""these temperatures are not just statistics, but have names and stories,"" mentioning a construction worker and an elderly man with no air conditioning who were her patients this summer. ""The planet has a fever,"" Salas said, ""and that's its symptom.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/hottest-decade-1.5427846,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/global-temperatures-wmo-1.5293624 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-climate-change-1.5183329 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-natural-disasters-canada-1.5416837 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/july-hottest-month-1.5233368 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/australia-bushfires-1.5414325 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greenland-ice-melt-1.5233597,/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-climate-change-1.5183329 /news/technology/global-temperatures-wmo-1.5293624 /news/politics/cost-of-natural-disasters-canada-1.5416837 /news/technology/july-hottest-month-1.5233368 /news/technology/greenland-ice-melt-1.5233597 /news/technology/australia-bushfires-1.5414325 /news/canada/north/arctic-warmest-in-10000-years-1.5094392 https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-2019-second-warmest-year-on-record
8,Erica Johnson,2019-04-02T17:51:22.864Z,"Bell customer's 5-month fight is 1 of almost 10,000 recent complaints to telco mediator","Matthew Tomlinson spent five months trying to get Bell to give him a TV package at the price he was promised. The 47-year-old Ottawa computer analyst says a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package last June, which cost him an extra $50 per month. ""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. Frustrated, Tomlinson filed a complaint with the telecom mediator, the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS). His complaint is included in a mid-year report released today by the CCTS, indicating that the number of Canadians unhappy with their telco service providers continues to climb. The CCTS says it accepted 9,831 complaints between August 2018 and January 2019 — a 44 per cent increase over the same period the previous year. The biggest issues for consumers: billing disputes, misleading contract terms or non-disclosure of information and poor quality of service. ""It's unfortunate that we see the same issues on a regular, recurring basis,"" CCTS commissioner Howard Maker told Go Public. He says by the time consumers have filed a complaint with his organization, they are often at their wits' end. ""It's difficult to see them all have to spend time and resources on things that maybe didn't need to have occurred, if better processes had been in place in the front end."" Ninety-two per cent of complaints to the mediator were resolved, although the CCTS could not address 6,413 other complaints beyond its mandate, including customer service, pricing and operating practices and policies. The country's largest service provider continued to receive a disproportionately high number of consumer complaints - Bell Canada was the subject of 3,034 complaints. Rogers received 915 complaints. For the first time, Cogeco placed third on the list, with 790 complaints, after an upgrade to its computer system led to customers losing service and being unable to contact technical support. Telus received 746 complaints, making it the fourth most-complained-about telecom provider. Freedom Mobile, owned by Shaw, expanded its service areas last year and placed fifth on the list, with 637 complaints. Customers filed the most complaints about cellphone issues (37.1 per cent), followed by problems with internet (27.8 per cent) and TV services (18.2 per cent). Canadians were only recently able to file complaints about TV services. That process was introduced into the CCTS mandate in September 2017. Tomlinson's complaint last fall said he paid an extra $50 per month after a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package.""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. ""Every time they told me that something was being fixed, it was never fixed. Every deadline or date they gave me … none of those deadlines were met."" Tomlinson estimates he went back to a Bell retail store more than 10 times, to try to sort out his billing issues. On top of that, he says, he spent countless hours on the phone to Bell. ""I'd go to sales and sales told me, 'No, this is a billing problem, you have to talk to billing.' So there was this really circular logic they were employing to simply keep me from being able to fix my bill."" Finally, Tomlinson complained to Bell's escalation department — but he still didn't hear back, so he filed a complaint with the CCTS. ""This is the most deplorable customer service I've ever experienced,"" he says. ""And I just didn't want it to go unchecked and unnoticed."" In an email to Go Public, Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson wrote, ""This kind of customer experience is rare, and we apologize to Mr. Tomlinson. We have provided coaching to all team members involved to ensure these kinds of mistakes are not repeated."" Gibson also noted that Bell's share of CCTS complaints ""declined more than any other service provider"" — by 2.4 per cent. Mike Polera says he filed a complaint last fall with the CCTS, after his experience trying to move his wife's cellphone from another service provider to his Rogers account. In terms of frustration, ""on a scale of one to 10, this was a 12,"" says Polera, a small business consultant based in Toronto. ""I've never seen anything like this."" Polera first contacted Rogers using a live chat agent, so he was able to save a copy of his chat and have a record of what was promised. When he went to a Rogers retail store to set up his wife's account, store reps couldn't help him and said there were no notes on his file. ""I actually had everything in writing and then found out that none of it was actually applied to my account,"" says Polera. ""It really made me angry. I felt completely taken advantage of."" In frustration, Polera took his cellphone business to another service provider. He says Rogers then charged him for services the company never delivered, including a $65 charge for a phone number that wasn't Polera's, and an activation fee. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'This is absolutely ridiculous',"" says Polera. ""Then I got angry."" After he wrote to the CCTS, Rogers issued him a credit for more than $350. Rogers spokesperson Sarah Schmidt told Go Public, ""We strive to deliver solutions for our customers the first time they contact us, and in this case we let Mr. Polera down. We see every customer complaint as an opportunity, and we have taken steps to ensure other customers do not experience the same situation."" A telecom watchdog says problems continue to exist in the telecom industry because companies get away with treating customers poorly. ""Fundamentally, the biggest problem with our system right now is there there aren't any strong penalties in place for the telecoms when they do something wrong,"" says OpenMedia's executive director Laura Tribe. ""Clearly, going through the CCTS and having a complaint filed is not a big enough threat to the telecoms to stop this behaviour."" Recently, the CRTC issued a report calling for more measures to prevent telecom companies from using aggressive and misleading sales practices. The recommendations are the result of an eight-month public inquiry conducted by the telecom regulator, prompted in part by months of stories by Go Public about the pressure on telco employees to upsell and mislead customers in order to meet sales targets. Rogers employees say managers turn a blind eye The CRTC report, issued in February, said harmful sales practices ""exist in all sales channels, including in store, online, over the phone, and door to door."" Among other things, the CRTC report recommended creating a mandatory internet code of conduct that could include price protections during a contract, and requiring telcos to allow a cooling-off period after purchasing products and services. Matthew Tomlinson says he still gets angry when he thinks about the hours involved trying to rectify his Bell bill, and the time thousands of other Canadians are spending, in similar situations. ""We don't want to be spending all this extra time away from our children, away from work, away from vacation planning, in order to deal with a problem that ultimately, in the end, it only took about 10 minutes to fix.""

Shipments of unwanted rubbish have been rerouted to Southeast Asia since China banned the import of plastic waste in 2018, but Malaysia and other developing countries are fighting back. Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said another 110 containers are expected to be sent back by the middle of this year. Yeo said the successful repatriation of a total 3,737 metric tonnes of waste followed strict enforcement at key Malaysian ports to block smuggling of waste and shuttering more than 200 illegal plastic recycling factories. Of the 150 containers, 43 were returned to France, 42 to the United Kingdom, 17 to the United States, 11 to Canada, 10 to Spain and the rest to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Portugal, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Lithuania, her ministry said. She said the Malaysian government didn't pay a single cent, with the costs of sending back the waste fully borne by the shipping liners and companies responsible for importing and exporting the waste. Yeo said talks were ongoing with U.S. authorities to take back another 60 containers this year. Canada also has 15 more containers, Japan 14, the U.K. 9 and Belgium 8 from 110 more containers that are still being held at Malaysian ports, she said. ""If people want to see us as the rubbish dump of the world, you dream on,"" Yeo told reporters during inspection at a port in northern Penang state. Yeo said the government will launch an action plan on illegal plastic importation next month that will help the different agencies co-ordinate enforcement and speed up the process of returning the waste. ""Our position is very firm. We just want to send back [the waste], and we just want to give a message that Malaysia is not the dumping site of the world,"" she added.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/malaysia-sends-back-150-containers-of-trash-1.5433003,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sp-malaysia-canada-garbage-1.5155558 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/we-are-going-to-send-this-back-malaysia-returning-unwanted-canadian-plastic-1.5152274,/news/world/sp-malaysia-canada-garbage-1.5155558 /news/world/we-are-going-to-send-this-back-malaysia-returning-unwanted-canadian-plastic-1.5152274 /news/technology/waste-recyclables-malaysia-philippines-cbc-explains-1.5153399
10,"Karissa Donkin, Jacques Poitras",2019-11-25T10:00:00.602Z,Former Joi Scientific employee says he debunked technology NB Power spent millions on,"A former employee of Joi Scientific said he debunked claims the company made about its hydrogen technology but quit after being unsatisfied with the company's response to his findings. NB Power is facing an end-of-year deadline to prove the Florida startup's hydrogen technology works, or the provincial government will pull the plug on the utility's Florida lab, which costs about $20,000 a month to run. The company has claimed it has found an efficient way to generate hydrogen from seawater on demand, something that would be a major innovation. NB Power and the Regional Development Corporation spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas has maintained the technology has ""potential."" ""We had independent validation and measurements, but there were parts that could not be measured,"" Thomas said at a legislature committee on Nov. 1. ""Some assumptions had been made. We're now back into an area where it's still promising but not to the same levels as we initially thought."" But according to Austin Walker, who worked at Joi Scientific as a lab technician between 2018 and 2019, the technology, or mechanism, as it was often called, is nothing new. ""They always said, 'the mechanism is doing this or that,' but there was never actually a defined mechanism,"" Walker said. ""There was always just vague theories."" The company was always keen to differentiate its technology from electrolysis, an established process that uses electricity to generate hydrogen gas and oxygen, Walker said. Electrolysis is considered wholly inefficient for power generation. But Walker said he proved to company executives that its technology is essentially just electrolysis by another name. That would make the company's claim of 200 per cent efficiency impossible, Walker said, because it would violate a law of thermodynamics that says ""you cannot create energy just kind of out of nowhere."" Walker was only 21 years old when he started at the company, fresh out of school, in the fall of 2018. Yet, he said that he was able to determine over the course of just a few months that the company's technology was nothing new. He had just finished a bachelor's degree in biology, with a minor in chemistry, at East Central University in Oklahoma when he was hired at Joi Scientific in October 2018. His job ranged from doing ""basic chemistry experiments to just learning more about the technology"" under the direction of the vice-president of science. Before his job interview, Walker reviewed Joi Scientific's website and its promotional materials. One marketing video, which claims that ""Joi Scientific has solved the problems that have kept hydrogen from being widely used for energy,"" caught Walker's eye because the video's claims sounded like ""perpetual motion,"" he said. ""Our patented extraction process takes a tiny amount of energy to start a chemical process, making enough hydrogen to power the process itself and generate plenty more for use in fuel cells and engines and boilers,"" the video says. Walker assumed he was the one who didn't know enough about the subject, especially since the company is based in the Space Life Sciences Center at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. ""I kind of had a healthy dose of skepticism right from the start, but it wasn't until about one or two weeks in that I really kind of was like, 'OK, yeah … something's not right here,'"" Walker said. Walker said the company came up with a slideshow for investors that includes a bullet-point list of reasons why its technology was not electrolysis. CBC News has not seen that list. ""I would look at that list of things and be like, 'None of that really makes sense, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact opposite in my own experimentation,'"" Walker said. A few months into his job at Joi Scientific, Walker began testing the bullet points from the list during his lunch breaks and said he was able to disprove one point in ""20 minutes at most."" In May, about two months after he began doing experiments to test the company's claims, Walker said, the company allowed him 15 minutes to present his findings at a staff meeting.  He said he was able to prove all but one point wrong. He also used part of his presentation to explain how electrolysis works. ""A lot of people didn't grasp the full weight of what I had said, so what I did after that is I went to people individually and kind of explained things,"" Walker said. He said these people included Robert Koeneman, the company's president and senior vice-president of technology. ""I went with Rob out to get drinks and kind of explain to him all of my thoughts in detail, to the point where I knew I had done my best to explain to him why everything was wrong,"" Walker said. On a call in midsummer, Joi Scientific told its shareholders that its technology didn't work as previously described, according to a record of the call obtained by CBC News. On that call, Joi Scientific CEO Traver Kennedy admitted the company had been calculating power incorrectly. But Kennedy didn't mention Walker's findings in May that Joi Scientific was performing electrolysis and didn't have groundbreaking technology. Walker is the second former Joi Scientific employee to raise concerns about the company's technology. He is also one of at least eight Joi Scientific employees who are no longer with the company. At its height this year, the company had about 20 employees, according to interviews with former employees and a review of LinkedIn profiles.  In addition to Walker, the departures included two executives who were in charge of science and engineering. NB Power declined an interview request for this story. Joi Scientific also declined an interview request. In an emailed statement, vice-president of marketing Vicky Harris said the company ""remains as committed as ever to continuing our work on our seawater-based hydrogen technology in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" She said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. Her statement didn't elaborate on the delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. Even though there were reportedly third-party verifications of Joi Scientific's technology, Walker believes people often ""take it for granted that you know what you're talking about."" ""Those third-party companies couldn't spend a month of testing like I did to check every little thing,"" Walker said. ""They had to take some of the stuff on faith and, yeah, I think that's probably how that happened."" In addition to operating a lab in Florida in the same building as Joi Scientific, NB Power has been sending its own employees, plus some engineers from Stantec, to work with Joi's technology. A spokesperson for Stantec declined an interview request to talk about its work on the Joi Scientific project. ""We are not authorized to speak to this matter, as per our agreement with our client,""  Stantec spokesperson Ashley Warnock wrote in an email. Expense reports show at least nine NB Power employees, including Thomas, have travelled to Joi's headquarters since 2016.  But it's not clear whether NB Power's own testing ever flagged any of the same issues Walker found during his lunch breaks. According to an Oct. 26, 2016, briefing note from NB Power, Joi Scientific's hydrogen production system is ""consistently repeatable"" and Joi's ""methodology used to evaluate the system's production ratio is reasonable and justifiable."" ""NB Power observed input to output ratio results which exceeded 100%,"" the briefing note says. It goes on to say the test results and data were consistent with claims made by Joi Scientific and ""with previous observations made at Joi Scientific at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida [in August 2016]."" It said NB Power's technical representative, an unnamed senior nuclear physicist, ""has spent approximately 24 hours of lab time with the system"" and ""has gained sufficient knowledge to understand the system's operation at a basic level and has confidence that the technology could be readily transferred to NB Power.""  Speaking to CBC News in May 2019, Thomas was a believer. ""We have seen results indicating, clearly indicating, independently witnessed, that it does produce more energy than in,"" Thomas said. Earlier this month, Thomas acknowledged the technology hasn't reached 70 per cent efficiency but maintained it still has ""potential.""  Walker became frustrated after attending a meeting with shareholders in May, where he said the company didn't mention any of the problems he said he raised earlier that month. ""It just seemed like they weren't even trying to portray the actuality of the company's situation, and I just felt that was kind of unethical,"" Walker said in an interview. ""Especially when some people were talking about continuing to invest more money into their company.""  Thomas, who sits on Joi Scientific's board, also attended that meeting, according to Walker. Walker described the tone as positive and said shareholders heard ""vague empty promises"" that he felt the company should have known wouldn't pan out.  ""I thought that there was just a line that crossed for me,"" he said. Walker said he quit his job later that day. He believes NB Power needs to audit things better before putting money in and suggested the utility should have sent electrochemists to assess the Joi Scientific technology. NB Power didn't respond to a question about how many, if any, electrochemists were sent to evaluate Joi's technology before it was licensed. ""I thought that the investors and people have a right to know how much their money is being wasted, especially if it's a government-run power company like it is in New Brunswick,"" Walker said.

11,Kimberley Molina,2020-01-20T19:42:18.035Z,Parents' patience wearing thin as school closures continue,"Some parents of children shut out of classes by yet another strike by teachers Monday say the ongoing labour dispute is causing turmoil for their families. Monday marks the first walkout by the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO), but it's actually the third time all elementary schools under the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) have closed since the job action began. Why were OCDSB elementary schools in Ottawa closed Wednesday? All 143 OCDSB elementary schools closed last Wednesday when the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF), which represents support workers who play vital roles in the day-to-day operation of elementary schools, staged a walkout. An earlier OSSTF walkout closed elementary schools on Dec. 4. The latest closure is pushing some parents to their limits. Dropping her tearful four-year-old daughter off at one of the special City of Ottawa-run day camps Monday, Reshma Bhimani said the strikes have disrupted their routine. ""We can't keep her home. We don't have extended families or parents who can take care of her. So, she has to go to daycare. We have to go to work."" Bhimani said she remains supportive of the teachers, but wants a quick resolution. ""We're actually reaching a saturation level now, and I think if [a walkout] does happen every week or every other week, it's going to come to a point where everybody's going to get frustrated,"" she said. ""For parents and for kids, it's important that they get back in school on a regular basis, and not having to go through this turmoil."" Other parents said their support for the teachers is beginning to wane because of the strain it's placing on both their finances and their time. ""I recently started school myself, so trying to find somebody to have my child for the day, and then having to pay that out of my pocket, being low-income, it's pretty ridiculous,"" said Amber-Lynn Côté, who also left her son at a camp for the day. ""They're playing in a gym right now, so they're not getting the education that they actually need."" Other parents said as tough as it's been on their families, they're still standing staunchly behind the teachers. Tara Peel dropped her two young children off at day camp after dropping off coffee and doughnuts for teachers on the picket line. ""Of course it's a bit of a challenge, a bit of a change in our routine in the morning, and the kids would much rather be at school learning, but we're grateful for the teachers for standing up and fighting for education,"" she said. ""I think the cuts that are being proposed by the Ford government will be much, much worse in the long run."" Parents were also divided on whether they would take the government up on its offer of up to $60 to offset the cost of child care when elementary school teachers are on strike.  $60 payout 'putting money back in parents' pockets', education minister says On Tuesday, all elementary and secondary schools under the Ottawa Catholic School Board will be closed as the union representing their teachers holds its own one-day walkout.

The premier, who was near Wet'suwet'en territory Friday while touring the LNG Canada project site in Kitimat, was asked by the chiefs for a face-to-face discussion while in the area, which Horgan declined. Chief Na'moks, who also goes by John Risdale, said only an in-person meeting from the premier demonstrates respect for the chiefs. ""I'm not going to drop everything I'm doing to come running when someone is saying they need to speak with me,"" said Horgan in an interview on Daybreak North Monday. ""I'm not being disrespectful, I'm just saying be realistic here."" Horgan said he had other obligations during this tour but did offer to speak to the chiefs by phone. His offer was not accepted. ""If you're going to have decent communication with anybody, it's best to be looking eye-to-eye,"" said Na'moks. ""We want to show the respect back, too."" An in-person meeting may not change the status quo, as Horgan said he has no plans to pull permits for a project he says is an economic chance for numerous other nations along the pipeline route who do support it.  ""I think its disingenuous to suggest that a handful of people can stop progress and success for people who have been waiting for a break like this for many, many years,"" said Horgan.  Coastal GasLink has signed benefit agreements with all 20 elected band councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline route. But the hereditary chiefs argue band councils only have jurisdiction over reserve lands rather than unceded territories. The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against supporters of the hereditary chiefs who have set up camps close to a pipeline work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order. ""There is no negotiating to be done,"" said Horgan.  Judith Sayers, assistant professor of law and business at the University of Victoria and president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, said the project ""flies in the face"" of Wet'suwet'en's own laws which have existed since time immemorial and need to be acknowledged. Sayers said under the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which passed in the B.C. Legislature in November 2019, Indigenous people have the right to own, use and manage their own lands.  ""We've moved into a new era in British Columbia with UNDRIP, which talks about the right of self-determination,"" said Sayers. ""Courts need to be acknowledging the laws of Indigenous people. We haven't seen that happen."" Horgan said UNDRIP is meant to be forward looking, not backward looking and this project was approved in 2018. There will always be conflict. There is conflict between families, conflict within communities. People don't always agree,"" said Horgan. ""We are doing our level best to move forward on issues in a respectful and methodical way.""

MLAs, auditor general's office reacted to foster parents' horror stories","N.W.T. politicians are responding to criticisms launched at the territory's troubled child welfare system, which foster families say is failing them and the children they care for. ""This is not going to go away,"" said Jackie Jacobson, MLA for Nunakput. On Friday, CBC published a letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the N.W.T., which alleged child protection workers had verbally abused and, in some cases, intentionally misled foster parents about children in their care. In subsequent interviews with CBC, foster parents described the department failing to take responsibility for children in their care going missing, or follow up on serious allegations of abuse. ""I know the frustrations that some [foster parents] are going through,"" said Jacobson. ""The whole system has got to be looked at."" Jacobson says he wants support for social workers, parents and families themselves who are navigating a system that is ""short staffed across the board.""  Everything comes down to the safety of children, said Jacobson.  The CBC contacted every sitting regular MLA to speak for this story. Members were in a budget meeting all day Friday. Kam Lake MLA Caitlin Cleveland, reflecting on the accounts from foster families this week, said in an email that it was ""very difficult to hear stories of people hurting, especially children."" Cleveland chairs the territorial government's Committee on Social Development, which will review and respond to the Foster Family Coalition's letter. ""I will continue to prioritize hearing their first-hand accounts to support the improvement of the N.W.T. foster care system,"" she wrote, thanking foster families for their trust and time. ""We need to ensure we are properly supporting social workers, birth families, and foster families to make sure we are supporting the success of our children."" The social development committee was previously tasked with reviewing the territorial government's response to the 2018 auditor general's report, authored by Glen Wheeler. Reached for comment on the Foster Family Coalition's letter, Wheeler said if change is going to happen, it might come down to political will. The auditor general doesn't ""have the power under the legislation to force a department to do anything,"" he said. ""It's up to MLAs as the elected representatives of the people and the minister of the department … to make sure the recommendations are fully implemented,"" said Wheeler. CBC reports about the treatment of foster families ""resonate with what we heard [in 2018],"" he said.  The last auditor general's report found there were no dedicated staff to manage the delivery of foster care across the territories. The system also didn't have support for caregivers beyond a daily rate provided to families, he said.  Asked whether a future report would consult foster families, Wheeler said the auditor general spoke to the Foster Family Coalition in 2014 and in 2018. ""I'm sure individual foster parents had important things to say … but the coalition, as a representative of the parents, was able to provide us with the perspective and information we needed to do our work,"" he said.  As of now, the auditor general has no plans for another audit.  It follows up on reviews, usually leaving a few years between reports, especially if recommendations need time to fulfil, said Wheeler. ""Given the severity of what we found in 2014 and the fact that when we went back in 2018, the situation in some ways was worse, it certainly is an area that we are going to continue to monitor,"" he said. The Auditor General of Canada has audited child and family services federally, and reviewed Yukon's delivery of child and family services. Asked whether any jurisdictions it audits are performing well, Wheeler said, ""if you look at other audit reports from other jurisdictions, it becomes obvious that most jurisdictions are struggling in this area."" ""It's a similar story unfortunately,"" he said.  Yellowknife North MLA Rylund Johnson said people who foster children are functionally frontline workers, but ""we don't often treat them as such."" Johnson wants the department to explain which of the coalition's recommendations it will take, and for the ones it rejects, he wants them to explain ""why we are not taking the suggestions from the people who are on the front lines."" He said MLAs have to support the department, and simultaneously, create policies that enable Indigenous children to stay in their communities.  ""At the end of the day, the state is taking Indigenous children from their homes. It's always going to be the most difficult thing we do as a government."" After the 2018 auditor general report, the territorial government increased funding to child and family services.  Auditor general reports, said Johnson, measure the government on how well it follows its own policies, but not whether they are the ""right policies."" ""That, from a political level, is the conversation we need to be having,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/child-welfare-mlas-1.5431953,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-foster-letter-response-1.5431878 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/foster-care-nwt-family-stories-1.5429286 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/foster-parents-letter-nwt-1.5427105,/news/canada/north/auditor-general-child-family-services-committee-update-1.4943338 /news/canada/north/nwt-cfs-reports-2019-1.5406054

Cheese's, is staking out her place in the genre of humour.  The book is a collection of essays about Midge's observations on life, politics, and identity as a Lakota woman living in the United States. ""There's just so much irony and so much absurdity in everyday living and everyday life, I just can't help but want to jot those down,"" said Midge.   ""[Writing] is a way to amuse myself, and just be able to use my imagination a lot … it's sort of a commentary that I have with myself, a conversation that I have with myself for the most part.""   One essay featured in the book, ""An Open Letter to White Girls Regarding Pumpkin Spice and Cultural Appropriation,"" is a tongue-in-cheek look at the mass availability of pumpkin spice products.   ""I live in Washington state where it gets kind of nippy and there's a lot of … white culture surrounding pumpkin spice, and coffees and lattes, and it's kind of become sort of a running joke,"" Midge said.  Midge added that her essay shouldn't be taken too seriously, but if you read between the lines, the essay examines deeper issues of consumer culture and cultural appropriation.   ""It addresses … a sort of privilege, especially with these big products like pumpkin spice which derive from Indigenous culture, like pumpkins, most definitely, like corn, beans and squash,"" said Midge. Even though her essays are comedic, there's also a lot of vulnerability in her writing.  ""With humour it's not going to be funny unless it is vulnerable. I think it's one of the most vulnerable things that we could ever attempt to do, is to try to put jokes out into the world,"" said Midge. ",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/stand-up-sketch-and-satire-the-rise-of-indigenous-comedy-1.5425646/so-much-absurdity-in-everyday-living-lakota-writer-s-musings-on-life-politics-and-identity-in-new-book-1.5430895,[],/radio/unreserved/stand-up-sketch-and-satire-the-rise-of-indigenous-comedy-1.5425646/so-much-absurdity-in-everyday-living-lakota-writer-s-musings-on-life-politics-and-identity-in-new-book-1.5430895 /radio/unreserved/stand-up-sketch-and-satire-the-rise-of-indigenous-comedy-1.5425646/i-m-indigenous-and-i-m-proud-of-it-cree-comic-inspires-sons-to-follow-in-his-footsteps-1.5425648 /radio/unreserved/stand-up-sketch-and-satire-the-rise-of-indigenous-comedy-1.5425646 /radio/unreserved/from-video-games-to-ya-novels-how-indigenous-art-is-evolving-1.4384041/canada-it-s-complicated-offers-truth-and-reconciliation-one-laugh-at-a-time-1.4384046 /radio/unreserved/lost-and-found-indigenous-music-culture-language-and-artifacts-1.4563023/indianthusiasts-uncovering-germany-s-obsession-with-first-nation-culture-1.4563027
15,Anonymous,2020-01-17T13:51:28.665Z,"Google parent, Alphabet, just became trillion-dollar company","As Google-parent Alphabet Inc became on Thursday the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion, some fund managers holding its shares are wondering whether now is the time to cash in on the stock's extraordinary gains. Shares of the Internet search giant are up nearly 17 per cent over the last three months, outpacing a broader rally in the S&P 500 index over the same period by 6 percentage points. Short interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1 per cent, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft and Facebook, according to Refinitv data. Alphabet joins Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value. ""Google is a stock that won't get you fired,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasn't added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. ""Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? I'm not sure about that."" Alphabet's shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes. Despite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28 per cent climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up. Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet's exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500. Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company's costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said. Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors' bullishness on the company: Alphabet's stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later. Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly seven per cent over the last six months, compared with a 10 per cent gain in the S&P 500 overall.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-trillion-dollar-company-1.5429960,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-alphabet-page-brin-pichai-1.5382998 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alphabet-board-investigates-sexual-misconduct-allegations-1.5353205,[]

17,Peggy Lam ,2020-01-16T00:06:47.055Z,The importance of dressing for the weather: Mom's cautionary tale of teen's frostbitten hands,"Like the parents of so many teens, Connie Gagan would badger her 16-year-old daughter to dress properly before heading out into the cold. Then last week, the Spruce Grove teen suffered excruciating frostbite to her hands after walking 45 minutes in –25 C temperatures without mitts or gloves, and Gagan has taken to social media to remind other parents of the importance of the battle. ""We just have to keep trying,"" Gagan said. ""We beat our heads against the brick wall, over and over and over. The message doesn't always get through but sometimes, it just does.""  Last Friday, her daughter finished an exam early and decided not to wait an hour for her ride, Gagan said. So she walked  home, carrying her binder in her bare hands.  Gagan said when her daughter got home, the pain from the frostbite kicked in.  ""I'm at work and she calls me, hysterical, because of the tremendous pain from when your hands start to thaw,"" she said.  ""She was crying, 'It just hurts mom, it just hurts so bad, mom,' and it's very difficult as a parent to see your child in that kind of pain. It was tough.""  They immediately went to a doctor and were instructed to soak her daughter's hands in cool to lukewarm water, Gagan said. The next morning, blisters had formed. The two headed to the hospital emergency room.  The teen was doing better on Wednesday, though she's still struggling with pain and mobility issues in her right hand, Gagan said.  ""We stopped having new blisters, but the existing blisters are still growing so we're not done with those. Now we're dealing with the risk of infection,"" Gagan said.  Dr. Raj Bhardwaj, an emergency room doctor from Calgary, says bad cases of frostbite can have severe consequences.  ""It's freezing the tissues and as they re-warm, they rupture,"" he said. ""So it can hurt nerves, it can damage blood vessels. It can damage tissue, even freeze your bone.""  In frostbite, the exposed skin will at first get cold and red, then it may go numb,  Bhardwaj said. ""That's actually when the bad frostbite is starting to set in,"" he said. ""It can actually go pale and hard, literally like frozen, waxy skin. As it warms up, if it gives you blisters, that's a bad thing.""  Blisters are a signal to head straight to the emergency room, he said. If you've got frostbite, avoid rubbing the skin, which can damage the frozen tissue, he said. And definitely don't warm your fingers over a heat register.   ""It can continue to add heat to it, to the point where it actually burns it and you don't feel the burn because you're still numb,"" he said.   Soaking frostbitten hands in lukewarm water — about 37 C — should help, he said. ""It's going to hurt as it starts to thaw out, so a little bit of ibuprofen can help with that.""  Gagan says she hopes her story can be a wake-up call for other kids and parents. She wants parents to talk to their kids about dressing appropriately for the cold weather.  She said it's been an ongoing struggle trying to get her daughter to wear gloves, mitts or a coat in the winter, but the teen now understands that not dressing for the weather is not a good choice.   ""She doesn't want to make that poor decision again,"" said Gagan.   ""She's trying to be tough still — she's a teenager, she wants to shrug it off like it's no big deal, but I know it is. I know it's been a wake-up call for her."" with files from Nancy Wilson, Lydia Neufeld",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/connie-gagan-teenager-frostbite-walking-home-1.5428143,[],[]
18,Erica Johnson,2019-04-29T16:46:41.471Z,'I had to crawl': Amputee seeks damages after United Airlines and airport security seize scooter batteries,"Stearn Hodge says he will never forget the humiliation of having to drag his body across a hotel room floor during what was supposed to be a vacation celebrating his 43rd wedding anniversary — because a security agent at the Calgary International Airport and United Airlines confiscated the batteries he needed to operate a portable scooter. ""Having to crawl across the floor in front of my wife is the most humiliating thing that I can think of,"" said Hodge. ""It unmasks how real my disability is … I haven't been the same since."" The 68-year-old retired contractor from Kelowna, B.C., lost his left arm and right leg in a 1984 workplace accident. He now relies on a portable scooter powered by lithium batteries. But on a trip to Tulsa, Okla., on Feb. 26, 2017, an agent with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and a United Airlines official told Hodge to remove the $2,000 battery from his scooter and fly without it, as well as his spare battery. In making the demand, both employees cited safety concerns. Stearn Hodge shows how he had to crawl when he didn't have his mobility scooter: Lithium-ion batteries are a potential fire hazard, but global standards issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) allow people with disabilities to travel with compact lithium batteries for medical devices in carry-on luggage. Hodge said no one from CATSA or United Airlines would listen to him or read IATA documents he had printed out, showing his batteries are permitted on board if an airline gives prior approval. Hodge had received that permission. ""They're taking my legs — and not only that, my dignity,"" said Hodge.  He can only wear a prosthetic leg for a short period due to discomfort and risk of infection, he said. A few months earlier, Hodge almost had his batteries seized on a WestJet flight. But ""seconds"" before takeoff — and after he suffered a panic attack — Hodge was granted permission to take them on board. He has now hired a lawyer and is fighting to have his case heard before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. A spokesperson for an Ottawa-based disability rights organization says it's ""frustrating"" that Canada's airline industry seems to ignore hard-won protections for people with disabilities. ""It's been a long fight to make sure that mobility devices — or any device used to accommodate a person with a disability — can be carried on [a plane],"" said Terrance Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. ""When security can — even with regulations in place — seize what otherwise should be able to go onto the aircraft, that leaves people with disabilities very vulnerable."" When the CATSA agent seized his batteries in Calgary, the employee suggested it wasn't a big deal, Hodge said. ""I still remember the CATSA agent saying, 'Well, you could get a wheelchair.' How's a one-armed guy going to run a wheelchair?"" asked Hodge. ""How am I going to go down a ramp and brake with one hand? But that shouldn't even have to come up."" Hodge's wife had recently undergone cancer treatment, which affected her spine, and she couldn't push a wheelchair for her husband. Hodge said he asked for an agent from United Airlines to come to the security checkpoint, as he had called the airline earlier and was assured it was OK to bring his battery and a spare on board. But the United Airlines employee that arrived sided with the security agent. Consequently, a three-week trip that was supposed to be a celebration with his wife resulted in Hodge spending much of his vacation confined to his bed. To perform basic personal hygiene, he was forced to drag himself across the hotel room floor to the bathroom. ""An anniversary is supposed to be all about remembering how you fell in love … and keeping that magic alive,"" said Hodge. ""And those things were denied. I'm crawling across the floor and it is pathetic."" A United Airlines spokesperson told Go Public that it couldn't comment on Hodge's experience, as he wants his case heard by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In an email sent to Hodge by the airline, complaint resolution official Tatricia Orija wrote that ""it appears we were in violation of federal disability requirements,"" offering both Hodge and his wife an $800 travel certificate. She also apologized for the ""inconvenience."" ""Inconvenience is when it rains on your holiday,"" said Hodge. ""This was a … life-changing moment for me and my wife."" Three months before the United incident, on Nov. 27, 2016, Hodge had also run into battery problems while travelling to Cancun, Mexico. In that case, a WestJet employee initially told him he could take the batteries in a carry-on, but when he got to the security checkpoint, a CATSA agent said the batteries had to be in checked luggage. ""According to federal airline law, that's the worst place you want to put them,"" said Hodge. ""Because if a problem develops with those batteries, they don't know where they are and they're only going to find out about it when it's too late."" Minutes before his departure, a WestJet employee was able to confirm that the batteries could go on the plane. In an email to Hodge, a WestJet customer support agent wrote: ""While I cannot change your past experience, I would like to offer you a $350 future travel credit as a goodwill gesture."" WestJet spokesperson Morgan Bell told Go Public he couldn't comment on the case since it is before the courts but that ""WestJet will always err on the side of caution and supports the due diligence of its people evaluating any items they believe may pose a safety concern.""  CATSA also wouldn't address questions from Go Public, citing Hodge's complaint. The agency did provide Hodge with a transcript of a recorded call with client service agent Justine Drouin, who apologizes to Hodge and says ""all of the screening officers will undergo a briefing."" Hodge and his wife travel at least once or twice a year and say the only place they run into trouble with his scooter batteries is in Canada. ""I have flown through Europe, the United States and Mexico since 2015 with these batteries and have never been detained or harassed because of them. It is only in Canada that I have been relentlessly detained,"" said Hodge.  He estimates it's happened more than a dozen times in the past two years, saying it now triggers severe anxiety. ""When I go through the checkpoint, I'm starting to vibrate now. I don't know what I'm going to get. It's like playing Russian roulette."" Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, said while he's pleased there are protections in place for people with disabilities who are travelling, those protections need to be enforced. ""This is an assault on a person's dignity,"" said Green, noting his organization has been fighting over transportation issues for four decades. ""In 1979, the government of the day said, 'Yes, we will make our transportation system accessible,'"" he said. ""Here we are … 40 years later and the same barriers are there in transportation for Canadians with disabilities."" Green, who is visually impaired, said he has had security agents question the battery in his laptop, which allows it to ""talk"" when it is turned on. He said he receives ""a lot of emails and telephone calls"" from people with disabilities who have been hassled at the airport. ""It happens very, very frequently,"" said Green. ""You put in complaints, the first thing that happens is the airlines deny."" Go Public asked the Canadian Transportation Agency, which regulates air, rail and marine travel, how often people have filed disability-related complaints over the past three years. A spokesperson said the agency has received 583 accessibility complaints related to air travel during that time — with fewer than one per cent related to batteries. And those numbers have steadily increased since 2016. The majority of complaints related to the transport of mobility aids are from passengers who have had expensive mobility devices — scooters and wheelchairs — damaged.   Last September, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred Hodge's complaint to the Canadian Transportation Agency. However, the agency has no power to award general damages beyond out-of-pocket expenses.  On May 9, Hodge's lawyer, John Burns, will ask a Federal Court judge to compel the commission to hear the case. ""It's a failure of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to grant access to the remedy that the statute provides,"" said Burns. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows for up to $20,000 in damages for each count of pain and suffering, and up to another $20,000 if the discrimination is ""willful or reckless."" ""It sends a very clear message to the airlines and everybody else involved,"" said Burns. ""People with disabilities should be taken seriously. You don't take away somebody's legs and then describe it as an inconvenience. No, this is an injury."" Hodge is optimistic he'll eventually have his day before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It's a pricey endeavour. In order to cover legal costs, he's had to put up for sale a cherished Corvette he has worked on for years. But it's a fight he says he has to have — not just for himself, but for so many others with disabilities. ""The thing I would love more than the compensation,"" said Hodge, ""is the [legal] decision that someone can go to and say, 'You did it here, you can do it for me.'""

The train shortage led to slight delays and longer waits on crowded platforms for this afternoon's commute. O-Train Line 1: The afternoon peak has ended. We are sorry for the higher than normal crowds and longer wait times earlier due to a shortage of trains. The Confederation Line had 13 working trains available when it launched Sept. 14. But a CBC source said only 11 double trains went into service Friday and Monday mornings. In a statement sent shortly before 3:30 p.m., OC Transpo's general manager John Manconi confirmed that 11 trains were in operation during the morning commute. He wrote that two more were taken out of service this morning due to technical issues — a compressor fault and a wheel issue. Manconi said Rideau Transit Maintenance advised the city that it would be running 10 trains ""instead of the required 13"" this afternoon and evening. Trains would operate approximately every five minutes during the afternoon peak, leading to wait times a minute longer than usual, Manconi said. This is the first time OC Transpo has blamed delays on a train shortage. One train was sent to the service garage for repairs on Thursday after its overhead power line ""snagged"" as it entered St-Laurent station. On Monday morning, OC Transpo tweeted about a mechanical issue on a train during a morning peak that caused delays, crowding and the closure of a platform at Tunney's Pasture. Monday's issues are the fifth and sixth announced by OC Transpo on the Confederation Line over the last five days, and eighth and ninth so far this month. Initially, OC Transpo planned to run 15 double trains during morning and afternoon peaks, plus another two kept aside as spares.

Are Red Tory values a thing of the past? ,"They came to the Anglican Cathedral on Thursday from far and wide, and from across the political spectrum, too.  At the front, while John Crosbie's family sat to one side of the cathedral, politicians sat to the other. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was there. Brian Mulroney and Joe Clark — the two prime ministers Crosbie served, and the two men who bettered him in the epic 1983 Tory leadership race — were there, Mulroney to deliver one of the eulogies. Premiers present and past were there. There were many others — including Bob Rae, the former Ontario premier whose political career includes (for our purposes) an irresistible footnote. In December 1979, as an upstart New Democratic MP, Rae put forward a subamendment to the Tory budget. It was designed to fail, and it did. The finance minister who saw his ""short term pain for long-term gain"" budget blow up in his face was Crosbie. Bygones, right? Rae was just 31 then; he's 71 now. Watching Crosbie's state funeral, I was struck to see how familiar faces from an earlier era have changed. We all age, and political movements and ideas — like the people who hold them — flourish and fade away, too. Even before Rae decamped to the Liberal party (the former NDP premier would go to be a prominent federal minister, and indeed interim leader of the party between Michael Ignatieff and Justin Trudeau), he likely had more in common with Crosbie than people might suppose. Crosbie may have been a fiscal conservative (his belt-tightening budget proved that) and an advocate for free trade throughout his life (do take a few minutes to read Anthony Germain's excellent essay on this), but he had other views that put him at odds with hawks in his party. I used the word ""Tory"" above. They were actually Progressive Conservatives. The federal party is long gone; provincially, they still exist, and the provincial PCs — led now by Crosbie's elder son, Ches Crosbie — have had an uneasy relationship, to say the least. Danny Williams, who created the 2008 ABC campaign against Stephen Harper that pretty much severed ties, was at the funeral too. Crosbie was truly progressive on some issues. He was pro-choice. As many people noted, the former justice minister was decades ahead of his time on LGBTQ issues. He sided with Pierre Trudeau on few political issues, but he also believed the state had no business in the bedrooms of the nation. Red Tories, so named for their fiscal conservatism and liberal views on social issues, were once plentiful. Hence the PC name. But Crosbie exited politics the very year that his party practically imploded, in the 1993 election. Reduced to just two seats, the PCs saw their constituencies picked apart from all sides: Quebec went to the Bloc, the NDP and Liberals were competitors for members on the left, and the upstart Reform party lured them from the right. A decade later, it was all over, at least federally. The PCs merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the new Conservative Party of Canada. Peter MacKay was at the helm of the PCs when he made that fateful decision. Many believed he had no choice. MacKay, the son of former federal minister Elmer MacKay, cut his teeth on the old Progressive Conservative system, but found himself bending with the times as Stephen Harper and the former Reformers effectively ate the old PC establishment whole.  How curious that Crosbie's funeral became the place where competing visions for the Conservative Party came together. Near Mulroney and Clark was Jean Charest, whose leadership aspirations are well known — and whose expected candidacy was apparently enough this week to prompt former prime minister Stephen Harper to resign from the party's financial arm, so he can counter Charest's campaign.  Crosbie, you may recall, supported Jean Charest's unsuccessful leadership bid in 1993. Charest evidently never forgot that.  Peter MacKay sat not far away from Charest. Just a day before attending Crosbie's funeral, MacKay entered the Conservative leadership race.  What values will MacKay bring to the race? While MacKay's political evolution strikes me at least partly as being about his survival, we can be certain he will not be championing the views of social conservatives.  After October's election, MacKay famously said outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's performance was so bad, ""it was like having a breakaway on an open net and missing the net.""  MacKay also emphasized that he thinks little of the gains that social conservatives are trying to make, and said Canadians weren't buying Scheer's views on abortion and LGBTQ rights.  ""That was thrust on the agenda and [it] hung around Andrew Scheer's neck like a stinking albatross, quite frankly,"" said MacKay.  Does that make MacKay a Red Tory? I don't think so. Although perhaps a Red Tory today is someone who will be content to hear silence from the social conservatives.  There are so many questions I would have liked to put to John Crosbie, and so many topics I would have liked to his comments.  You can be sure the forthcoming leadership race — which could be for Canada's conservative soul — will be something he would have loved to watch.  Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/wekeend-briefing-red-tories-1.5430494,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/john-crosbie-funeral-1.5427560 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/weekend-briefing-john-crosbie-1.5422491 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/weekend-briefing-conservative-aftermath-1.5343972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mackay-scheer-conservative-leadership-1.5341633,/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/germain-analysis-crosbie-trade-1.5428169 /news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/weekend-briefing-john-crosbie-1.5422491 /news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/john-crosbie-obituary-1.5413882
21,Bryan Eneas,2020-01-18T23:53:38.761Z,Montreal Lake Cree Nation increasing both treatment and security in battle against crystal meth,"A central Saskatchewan Cree nation is taking a multi-pronged approach to dealing with a crystal meth issue in its communities. The Montreal Lake Cree Nation has high levels of meth use, according to Lionel Bird, the Cree Nation's director for child and family services.  In order to combat meth use, the community is beefing up security and providing options for community members seeking help.  In October last year, the band announced it would be opening a land-based crystal meth treatment facility. Now, the band is opening a crystal meth detox facility on reserve.  While there is a detox facility in Prince Albert, roughly 100 kilometres south of Montreal Lake, Bird said band members have expressed concerns about the length of stays there.  He said the Cree Nation's newest facility has eight beds and allows people to stay for 14 days, before transferring to the land-based treatment facility for six months of further help.  ""Everybody's impacted. There's not one of us who isn't impacted by having one of our relatives that is on crystal meth,"" Bird said. He said it isn't unusual to hear of suicide attempts on a weekly basis.  Bird said those attending the new detox facility can expect to undergo a series of tests to determine their physical and mental condition. From there, patients are monitored to ensure they aren't going through serious withdrawal symptoms.  Bird said the land-based crystal meth treatment facility and the crystal meth detox facility will begin taking patients in on Wednesday. The band is considering opening up treatment for other drugs and alcohol but right now both will focus solely on crystal meth. He said the band has researched the topic of crystal meth addiction extensively and has found the best way to treat the drug is through 18 months of comprehensive programming.  Bird said the band is also looking at the possibility of opening up a long-term facility in a remote location where patients would be kept clean from the drug for six months after attending both the detox facility and the land-based treatment facility. ""[There], they learn how to look after themselves, how to feed themselves, how to clothe themselves, all the different things,"" Bird said.  He said due to the band's situation, with roughly 60 per cent of its population addicted to the drug, the facilities will only be available for band members to use.  Bird said gang members are involved in the drug trade on reserve, and in some cases young people are being asked to sell the drug in the community.  ""Nobody feels safe,"" Bird said. ""We've had a couple of shootings already here on reserve as a result of gang wars and non-payment issues where they come and collect. It's no longer just breaking bones; it's actually just shooting up the house."" He said the band has hired its own security team who are blocking the reserve roads on days where payments are distributed to community members.  He said suspicious vehicles or individuals are reported.  ""So far a whole whack of weapons have been seized,"" Bird said. ""A high amount of drugs were seized and these were all our local response teams that have stepped up and prevented this kind of stuff from coming into the community.""  Bird said the community also has a crisis response team who attend calls with people who are trying to hurt themselves or others. Those people try to defuse the situation at hand and try to find therapy services and housing opportunities for the people involved in the situations. He said the band is in conversation with the federal government, seeking an additional five years of funding dollars to keep the projects alive.  Bird said on top of the security and crisis response team positions that have been created, the detox facility and the land-based treatment facility are also staffed almost entirely by band members. Bird said the band advertised for positions at both the treatment centre and detox facility nationally, but many of the qualified candidates came right from Montreal Lake. ""I'd say about 90 per cent of the people that are going to be working in these facilities are local people and or First Nations from other areas.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mlcn-tactics-combat-crystal-meth-use-1.5432328,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/montreal-lake-meth-crisis-wildfire-evacuation-1.5134061,[]
22,Erica Johnson,2019-05-01T09:00:00.135Z,Bank employees angry regulator's report on sales tactics weakened after banks and government review drafts,"Several bank employees are speaking out, angered by recent revelations that a report on banking sales tactics was weakened after the regulator shared a draft copy with the banks and federal government. They contacted Go Public to reveal why they think upselling wasn't widely detected during a lengthy review of misleading sales tactics by the regulator — slamming the bank review as inaccurate, inappropriate and a PR exercise. The employees provided internal documents disclosing aggressive upselling they said isn't obvious and said they were frustrated by a recent Go Public story that showed a report released by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada last year had key consumer protections eliminated after early drafts were shared with the federal Finance Department and the big banks. ""When I saw the regulator gave the report to the banks, I couldn't believe it,"" a CIBC call centre employee wrote to Go Public. ""I had to reach out to you."" CBC has confirmed the identity of bank employees in this story, but is not revealing them to protect their employment.  The regulator told Go Public it gave banks a draft report so they could identify factual errors. The review was conducted in 2017 and culminated in a report released on March 20, 2018. The FCAC's handling of its bank review is grounds for a public inquiry into the regulator and Canada's financial services, says the Small Investor Protection Association (SIPA), a consumer advocacy organization. ""It's proof that the Department of Finance is complicit with the FCAC and is deceiving the public,"" SIPA president Stan Buell told Go Public. The CIBC call centre employee says she was one of the people interviewed by the FCAC as part of its review.  The regulator interviewed some 200 bank employees at various branches of BMO, CIBC, RBC, TD, Scotia and National Bank as well as 400 more employees — some of whom, worked at banking call centres. ""That whole interview was an exercise in public relations,"" she says. She says during the interview, she wasn't transparent about the pressure to meet sales targets, because she worried the process wasn't confidential.  Been wronged? Contact Erica and Go Public team ""Did I tell them we were pushing sales hard? No way,"" she says. ""How did I know that wouldn't get back to someone?"" She says she has sold things to help the bank's bottom line and meet sales targets, but has made it seem as though it is in the best interest of the client. ""At every telephone banking level, we are trying to sell to the client."" She says she had to vent, after learning the regulator's report was weakened, after early versions were sent to banks and government. ""It just made me really angry, reading what went on behind the scenes,"" she says. In an email to Go Public, CIBC's director of public affairs Trish Tervit says the bank ""supplied complete org charts"" to the FCAC.  ""The bank did not select which employees were interviewed as part of the FCAC's industry-wide review,"" wrote Tervit. ""Putting clients at the centre of all we do is our priority every day. We have a strong, client-focused culture and we continuously review our business to ensure we do what's right for our clients."" A Scotiabank financial adviser says he thought it was inappropriate for the FCAC to let banks see the draft report.  ""The banks shouldn't have had any say in it, in any way,"" he says. ""That's shocking to me."" He says his sales targets have sharply increased since last November. He says employees are upselling customers simply to meet sales targets, but that much of that harm would be impossible for the regulator to detect. He provided a screenshot of an internal website, showing that the higher an interest rate an employee quotes a customer on a mortgage, the more sales units they earn towards their target.  ""They [customers] don't know they could've got a lower mortgage rate,"" says the financial adviser. ""I don't know how upselling would ever be tracked."" Another example of upselling he said the regulator couldn't detect is the way employees are encouraged to move clients away from investing in GICs and steer them into mutual funds, which provide guaranteed annual fees for the bank. To meet sales targets, he says he pushes mutual funds because he gets double the amount of credit. ""That can be harmful to customers,"" he says, ""because a mutual fund might not make sense."" In an email to Go Public, Scotiabank director of Canadian banking communications Patricia Hsiung wrote, ""Any reports that Scotiabank has set aggressive sales targets are inaccurate and misleading. Scotiabank remains committed to delivering an exceptional, transparent and trustworthy experience for our customers that prioritizes our relationships over products."" She also wrote that the bank considers ""customer feedback from more than one million surveys yearly"" and is making, ""great strides in driving towards industry leadership in overall customer satisfaction."" Another Scotiabank financial adviser working in a different city also contacted Go Public to say he was disturbed to see the regulator's report was weakened after it went to government and the banks, and that the regulator's claim that it did not find that bank customers were widely harmed — is not accurate. He provided documents showing his sales targets had significantly increased as of last fall. ""The pressure is enormous,"" he says. ""We're lying to our clients. Upselling all the time. You don't want to do it, but if you don't, you'll lose your job."" He says the regulator wouldn't know his manager tells him to gloss over the fees attached to a mutual fund. ""People will back out if they know there's risk involved, or fees,"" he says. He says he also increases credit card limits because he's under pressure to hit sales targets, but the FCAC wouldn't be able to tell that either, by looking at files. ""If they [bank customer] have an existing card with a $5,000 credit limit, I'll say, 'I see you're pre-approved for $10,000, let's attach that to your file,'"" he says. ""I don't ask the client if that's a good thing for them, in case they say no. I need to make points for my sales target."" News that the banking regulator provided draft copies of its review into aggressive sales tactics to government and the banks has prompted renewed calls for a public inquiry into financial services and the FCAC from the Small Investor Protection Association. ""I really think the government needs to listen to the voices of the people, to understand what their needs are and the impact on their lives, due to the lack of investor protection,"" says Buell. ""The FCAC should be providing that, but is not."" In a statement released earlier this week, Buell said an independent inquiry is necessary because ""Canadians are entrusting their hard-earned money, savings and futures with what should be trusted institutions and individuals."" ""There appears to be a far too cosy relationship between the banking industry, the FCAC and the Finance Department,"" says Buell. Go Public asked Finance Minister Bill Morneau about claims that the report was weakened after he saw it. ""Obviously, it's always important for us to take a look at how the banking sector is working,"" he says.  ""And I'm confident the FCAC did a good job."" Regardless of whether or not a public inquiry is called, one of the Scotiabank financial advisers who reached out says he has a message for banks, and for bank customers.  ""They [the banks] need to stop being so greedy and ripping people off,"" he says. ""And when people go to the bank, they shouldn't trust what we say. We're under pressure to sell, but we can't tell you that."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

The festival had been held on the ice near the Conexus Arts Centre — an area the Saskatchewan government said is near a federally designated migratory bird sanctuary.  ""Shoreline degradation caused by the ice surface location directly impacted nesting habitat, food and protection for waterfowl,"" said Jonathan Tremblay, director of communications for the Ministry of Government Relations, in an emailed statement.  ""For Waskimo to continue using the ice surface in the Wascana marsh area, they would be required to apply for permits under the Aquatic Habitat Protection Program and the Migratory Bird Convention Act, both of which outline concerns with alterations to habitat."" Tremblay said the Provincial Capital Commission also offered help in the form of an on-land ice surface on the west side of Broad Street at no cost, plus $5,000 for facility rental costs. ""We are sad to see the event cancelled by the organizers, but we certainly look forward to working with them on an environmentally sustainable solution in future years,"" Tremblay's email said. It was decided that the festival would be cancelled after the Waskimo board met with the government multiple times about the shore line concerns, said Jeremy Parnes, chair of the Waskimo Winter Festival committee. ""This is just the reality of having that many people on the ice at that time,"" Parnes said. ""We are truly saddened that we are not able to do it this year."" Parnes said without the ice, there wouldn't be events like the skating competition and outhouse races, which would make the event a shadow of itself, so it was cancelled. It's unclear if the festival can be moved or held in another area, Parnes said, but added the board is considering the options available. ""We're a passionate group. We don't give up easy and we don't take no for an answer,"" Parnes said. ""So that bodes really well for our positive possibilities in 2021.""

24,Natalie Valleau,2020-01-20T16:04:24.013Z,"Facial expressions of cats reveal their inner moods, study says","Remember Grumpy Cat? For most cat owners and veterinarians, knowing a cat's mood isn't as easy as the popular meme. However, according to a new study by the University of Calgary and the Université de Montréal, you can now tell a lot about how a cat is feeling from certain facial expressions. Dr. Daniel Pang, University of Calgary researcher and veterinarian, says he has co-developed, along with Dr. Paulo Steagall, the ""Feline Grimace Scale"" — which was published in Scientific Reports. He says the goal of the scale is for veterinarians to be able to identify if your feline friend is experiencing any pain. ""With cats, when they're undergoing the same procedures or surgeries as dogs, they tend to receive less pain relief because we just struggle to identify when they're painful,"" he told the Calgary Eyeopener on Friday. ""Which, of course, means it's harder to manage their pain as well."" The veterinarian says the study exemplified the key things to look at — like the position of their ears, eyes, muzzle and whiskers. ""They just look as though they have kind of a buildup of tension in their face,"" he said. Pang says the scale will also show the level of pain and how extreme it is.  ""It really helps veterinarians decide if they should do something about it or not.… Our focus is really on the pain aspect because that's the thing that we all struggle with as veterinarians,"" he said. The study has created a free training manual for veterinarians so they can use the Feline Grimace Scale at their practices.  ""One of the things we really like about it is it's a scale that seems to be pretty fast to use because we all know everyone's busy at work, and if something takes you more than a minute, you're just not going to do it,"" he said.  ""Hopefully, we'll see that knock-on effects and better benefiting cats as well."" Don't worry, no cats were harmed in the making of this study. Pang says the cats that were tested were being brought to the hospital because they were sick or in pain. ""What made it really useful was when we gave the cats pain relief, we could see the changing faces, so see their faces becoming much more relaxed and happy looking,"" he said. ""It was really that response to pain medication that helped confirm to us that we really were identifying pain."" By identifying this, veterinarians are able to decide how much pain medication to give or whether it's working well. ""A big part of it is if people are not sure of pain presence, they hesitate to decide to do something about it, and a lot of the drugs we use to relieve pain have side-effects,"" said Pang. ""If you're then worrying about the side-effects, it makes you hesitant or shy to start giving out medication without knowing if the animal really needs it or not.""

25,Benjamin Shingler,2020-01-21T01:39:31.766Z,"Long lines for private refugee sponsors show need for reform, advocates say","Dozens of people spent the weekend in a Quebec Immigration Ministry office in Montreal, some of them sleeping on the floor or on fold-out chairs, in the hope of being able to sponsor a refugee. Not all of them were successful. Originally from  Afghanistan, Sharbano Rezai's family is living in Iran as refugees. Rezai spent three nights in the ministry office, hoping to finally bring them to Canada. She was 49th in line, but she isn't sure if the government will even read her documents because some people ahead of her were delivering upward of 10 applications. ""This is not fair,"" she said. ""This is a not about just staying in line for three nights. This is about people's lives."" The province is only accepting 750 applications for private sponsorship for the coming year on a first-come, first-served basis.  The process, critics say, is inefficient and inhumane. ""It's a bit of a mess inside,"" said Sylvain Thibault, a would-be sponsor and longtime refugee advocate. ""It really looks like a refugee camp. There are people who have been here 24 hours a day since Thursday around noon. So it's been four days."" Last week, advocates had raised a concern that potential sponsors would be forced to spend the weekend outside in the cold in the hope of securing a spot. The province ended up opening the Immigration Ministry's doors starting Friday evening, so would-be sponsors could wait inside. It also provided coffee and water, said a ministry spokesperson. The available spots were quickly filled when the government began accepting applications Monday morning.  The government required that the applications be dropped off at the ministry office by a courier, not mailed or dropped off by the applicant.  Some couriers charge upwards of $500 per application and submitted multiple applications, Radio-Canada reported. There was a long line the last time the province accepted applications, as well, in September 2018. The Quebec program, modelled on the federal one, has been popular from the start, leading to such a backlog of unprocessed applications that in 2017, the program had to be suspended for more than 18 months while the government processed thousands of existing applications. In total, more than 9,000 refugees were accepted into the province in 2017 (many are brought in through a federal government-assisted program, not through private sponsorship). However, the Coalition Avenir Québec government, which was elected in 2018 on a commitment to reduce immigration, says it aims to cut the number of refugees to between 7,200 and 7,500 in 2020, with a maximum of 3,350 sponsored refugees. The government has justified its promise to reduce the number of immigrants overall by saying it wants to focus efforts on better integrating people.  Paul Clarke, the head of Action Réfugiés, said last week the system isn't working. ""We're ready to welcome more people, and we have the capacity to sponsor them. The numbers that are being permitted are too low.""  Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette acknowledged there are problems with the current approach, and he said the process of submitting applications through a courier will be reviewed.  ""Many of our immigration programs need to be modernized. This is the case for collective sponsorship, and we will work on it,"" he said in a statement. He also said Quebec ""recognizes the principle of international solidarity"" with respect to refugees and takes in ""more than its fair share, in terms of humanitarian immigration.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-private-refugee-sponsorship-1.5426370,[],/news/canada/montreal/quebec-private-refugee-sponsorshipt-1.5431157 /news/canada/montreal/quebec-immigration-simon-jolin-barrette-1.5370328 /news/canada/montreal/quebec-immigration-peq-legault-1.5350730

In a brief, the lawmakers laid out their arguments supporting charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against the president. ""The Senate should convict and remove President Trump to avoid serious and long-term damage to our democratic values and the nation's security,"" the lawmakers said, for the first time formally calling for the Senate to convict the president and remove him from office. ""The case against the president of the United States is simple, the facts are indisputable, and the evidence is overwhelming,"" they said.

""My heart pretty much dropped to my stomach,"" Lidhar told Go Public from his home in Surrey, B.C. ""We just assume our money's safe."" Soon after, the cybercriminals stole another $2,000. But worst of all, Scotiabank refused to reimburse him. ""It is not acceptable to have your money stolen from your account and the bank — which you trust so much with your life savings — tells you they can't do much to help."" Lidhar is the victim of a ""systemic problem"" of criminals breaking into people's online accounts and stealing money, according to Christopher Parsons, a senior public policy researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. Parsons argues that the country's banks, not their customers, should be financially liable when thieves raid customer accounts. ""The banks are responsible — solely responsible — for building and maintaining the infrastructure,"" he said. ""We need to reverse the liability the banks currently impose upon individuals who are using the very services and tools that banks are providing.""  The trouble started for Lidhar on Feb. 11, when hackers broke into his account and e-transferred $3,000 in two transactions — one for $2,000 and one for $1,000 — to an email address he says he doesn't recognize. As soon as he learned about it, Lidhar says he changed his password, got a new debit card, asked Scotiabank to freeze his accounts and stopped banking online. Scotiabank said it would investigate, but when Lidhar didn't hear back after two weeks, he visited his local branch. While speaking to someone in the fraud department, they told him money was again being transferred out of his account. ""I was totally shocked and blown away that this was happening while I was in the branch,"" he said.  Been wronged and you're not the only one?

Lidhar says Scotiabank took a few weeks to investigate, and then said it wouldn't cover his losses.  In an email, Scotiabank said his claim was denied because the transaction was authorized from an internet address where he has ""extensive history."" Security experts tell Go Public that hackers can access a bank account from a victim's IP address by taking over an infected computer and logging in as if they were that person. Lidhar says Scotiabank wouldn't explain how the fraud happened, adding that only he has access to his account.  ""They're trying to blame me,"" he said. ""And they haven't told me anything about who it went to."" In a statement to Go Public, a Scotiabank spokesperson said the bank ""took immediate action and conducted a thorough investigation,"" into Lidhar's case.  ""We take the concerns of our customers very seriously,"" wrote Douglas Johnson. After Go Public contacted Scotiabank, it offered to compensate Lidhar — six months after his money was stolen.  Go Public has heard similar stories from others — all saying their accounts were hacked, and that the banks often won't reimburse them. In May, Martin Chapman of Peterborough, Ont., lost almost $12,000 when criminals broke into his accounts at TD Bank and Royal Bank. Initially, he says, TD refused to fully compensate him, offering just $1,805. ""They have admitted to me they don't know how the scammer broke through their security system,"" said Chapman. Only after he appealed did TD agree to reimburse all $6,000. RBC refunded the remaining money after a two-week investigation. TD would not respond to questions from Go Public about this case.  Curtis Hamilton of Esquimalt, B.C., says he was targeted by hackers last November who installed a key logger on his computer and sent just over $2,000 to themselves. TD's fraud department said Hamilton didn't protect his password and it was his fault. Hamilton had anti-malware software on his computer. He's hired a lawyer but has yet to get his money back. ""It's been quite frustrating,"" he said. ""The bank is basically saying … 'We're not responsible for anything.'"" TD would not comment on this case, when asked by Go Public. Patricia Widdis of Breslau, Ont., told Go Public that hackers accessed her RBC account and redirected her Visa payments, stealing $12,000 in May 2018. The bank was able to get $7,000 returned, but she is still out $5,000 and feels betrayed. ""They said, 'You made the payments yourself,'"" said Widdis. An RBC spokesperson wrote that potentially unauthorized transactions are analyzed ""on a case-by-case"" basis. Most Canadians are unaware that more criminals are hacking into financial institutions in Canada and around the world, says security expert Limor Kessem.  ""These threats are very real and very problematic,"" said Kessem, an adviser based in Tel Aviv with IBM X-Force, an international team of investigators who track global security threats to the financial sector. ""In the beginning,"" she said, ""we would see that a banking trojan [a type of virus] would be targeting banks through their customers,"" such as GozNym, a malware attack she helped uncover and that was shut down in May, as part of an international law enforcement operation. GozNym targeted two financial institutions based in Canada — which Kessem won't name — and 22 U.S. banks, credit unions and popular e-commerce platforms, stealing sensitive personal and financial information, including online banking login credentials such as usernames and passwords. It's estimated GozNym stole over $100 million from some 40,000 victims. It's an example of the sort of malware that might be responsible for the hacks against Lidhar, Hamilton and Chapman.  ""And then we have a different type of attack,"" said Kessem. ""Cybercrime groups that will invade the banks' actual infrastructure and get into their payment systems and start compromising them internally."" It all points to the need for financial institutions to take responsibility when hackers steal customers' money, says Parsons, the public policy researcher.  ""They can't just provide us tools or push liability upon us and then walk away,"" he said. ""One of the ways of correcting this would be to shift the liability structure. So rather than punishing customers … the banks themselves should be liable, so that they're encouraged to build way better security and protect their customers from this sort of fraud."" In the U.K., says Parsons, banking fraud was such a big problem, the government made banks responsible for financial losses to customers.  ""And as soon as the banks had to take those losses, all of a sudden … fraud plummeted because the banks invested massively in security,"" said Parsons. He says Canada's next government needs to follow the U.K.'s example.  ""If banks themselves won't do it, then it's an area where legislation needs to be seriously considered. We can't rely on customers to know about every kind of security vulnerability, to track every website that has breached passwords,"" he said. ""That's just absolutely absurd and not a feasible solution to the problem."" Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association — which represents Canada's largest banks — whether its members would consider assuming liability when hackers break into the online banking systems they have created. A spokesperson did not address that question, but wrote, banks ""have no higher priority than the security of their customers' money and conduct comprehensive investigations of all fraud cases, some of which are complex and take time to investigate the specifics of the case."" All the banks involved in these cases have told Go Public that customers are responsible for taking precautions to ensure their devices, accounts and information are protected. Sunjit Lidhar says he's stopped doing online banking and now heads to his bank branch instead — a hassle he says is worth it, for peace of mind. He says he wrote to Go Public to let people know that banks could hold them responsible when hackers strike. ""I just want people to know that this is something that's very real,"" says Lidhar. ""It's not safe. And that's something they [the banks] need to work on."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Prime Minister Erna Solberg said she would continue with a minority government comprised of three coalition partners — her own Conservatives, the centrist Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats. Progress Party Leader Siv Jensen said ""the cup is now full"" after the decision to allow the woman to return to Norway — a decision on which her anti-immigration party feels it was not consulted. She said when Solberg's coalition expanded a year ago to include the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, veering more to the centre and becoming a majority government, ""enthusiasm dropped."" ""Over time, politics was too much based on compromises,"" said Jensen, who is Norway's outgoing finance minister. Prime Minister Solberg said she ""understood"" why the Progress Party wanted to leave her coalition government. She said she would seek co-operation with the party — which is Norway's third-largest. Norway's next parliamentary election is scheduled for September 2021. To stay in office until then and pass legislation in the 169-seat parliament, Solberg needs the support of parties outside the government, including the Progress Party. The 29-year-old Norwegian woman of Pakistani descent reportedly travelled to Syria in 2013 and married a Norwegian foreign fighter there who was later killed in fighting. One of her children is quite ill. She was formally arrested Saturday upon her return and was placed in an Oslo hospital with both children. Jensen said many believed that the woman, who has not been named, ""used her child as a shield to come back to Norway."" ""There are many … who are displeased by this, not just in the Progress Party,"" Jensen said last week. The mother, who was not named, refused to let the sick child travel alone to Norway, which then allowed her to travel from the Kurdish-controlled camp at al-Hol where all three had been detained since March 2019. ""A majority in the government believed that concern for the child was paramount,"" Solberg said. Solberg has been prime minister of the Scandinavian country since 2013, when she formed a coalition with the Progress Party. The parties won renewed support in 2017 elections. At the Finance Ministry, the new appointee to replace Jensen will chart the course for the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, with assets of $1.1 trillion US.

Premier Caroline Cochrane should be hosting meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney to make sure the Indigenous communities living within the Mackenzie water system will not be affected by the controversial $20.6 billion Teck Frontier mining project that is proposed for a site 110 kilometres north of Fort McMurray, Alta.  A joint federal-provincial review board deemed the Teck Frontier mine in the public interest last July, despite ""significant adverse ... effects"" to the environment, species at risk and the traditional practices of Indigenous peoples. Federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has the final say on whether the project goes forward. He must decide before the end of February.  If approved, the Teck Frontier mining project would produce 260,000 bitumen barrels a day and create 7,000 jobs in Alberta. Its lifespan is estimated to be 41 years.    Joslyn Oosenbrug, a communications manager with the N.W.T.'s Environment Department, said in a statement that the territory is the ""ultimate downstream jurisdiction"" of the Mackenzie River basin and that ""N.W.T. waters can be impacted"" by management decisions in Alberta.  In 2015, the Northwest Territories and Alberta signed a bilateral water management agreement to preserve the quantity and quality of the territory's water. Oosenbrug said Alberta must take action if the water quality deteriorates.  The territorial government did not make a submission to the joint federal-provincial review board on the Teck Frontier mining project.  Oosenbrug also said the territory monitors the water quality for any effects that could come from upstream oil extraction. The government has had a water monitoring site at Fort Fitzgerald, Alta., since the 1960s, which gives early warnings of any environmental changes in the Slave River.  Part of the Smith Landing First Nation's traditional territory runs just south of the border between the Northwest Territories and Alberta, along the Slave River and into the Peace-Athabasca Delta.  Smith's Landing First Nation was only invited to join the review panel at their last session in October 2018 after pressuring Alberta on at least four separate occasions for the right to consult, said Becky Kostka, the land and resources manager for the First Nation.  In its final submission to the Alberta government, Smith's Landing First Nation argues that it has seen a noticeable decline in water levels, water quality and air pollution — all stemming from other resource projects in northern Alberta. Transcripts from members of the Smith's Landing First Nation in that report say the Slave River is ""at a tipping point"" and that another resource project could ""seal the fate"" of the nation. Jess Sinclair, press secretary to Alberta's environment minister Jason Nixon, said in a statement that Smith's Landing First Nation did not identify any specific sites that needed mitigation from the Teck Frontier project.  The Aboriginal Consultation Office, an arm of Alberta's provincial government that specializes in Indigenous consultation, found that consultation with the First Nation was adequate.  Chief Cheezie will be speaking at a press conference in front of the environment minister's Vancouver constituency office Monday. He and other Indigenous advocates will be presenting the minister's office with a joint letter expressing their concerns over the Teck Frontier project.  ""We haven't been sitting on our hands here because we see the immense danger to our people,"" he said. ""We're not going anywhere. Forty one years from now ... when the mine shuts down, Teck will leave but we will still be [here]."" Cheezie said Smith's Landing is also actively lobbying other federal ministers, including Dan Vandal, the new minister responsible for northern affairs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/smiths-landing-nwt-teck-frontier-1.5431837,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187,/news/canada/calgary/teck-oilsands-mine-frontier-carbon-wilkinson-minister-climate-1.5400525 /radio/day6/mourning-iran-crash-victims-former-weinstein-aide-zelda-perkins-watching-cats-while-high-design-20-more-1.5421075/as-the-deadline-to-approve-a-massive-oilsands-project-approaches-its-economic-benefit-is-up-in-the-air-1.5421079 /news/canada/edmonton/fort-mcmurray-panel-mine-oilsands-frontier-1.5227445 /news/canada/edmonton/trudeau-liberals-climate-change-politics-alberta-kenney-1.5409028

The Ktunaxa Nation in the East Kootenay will create a conservation zone in the towering mountains and glaciers around the Jumbo Valley, which has been in the eye of developers for three decades. ""I believe this is a positive outcome to what was an extremely challenging situation,"" said Kathryn Teneese, Ktunaxa Nation council chair. The Ktunaxa calls Jumbo Qat'muk and say it's home to the grizzly bear spirit and therefore sacred.  But for almost 30 years, the Jumbo Glacier Resort project team led by Vancouver architect Oberto Oberti has been trying to build a billion-dollar year-round ski resort there.  In 2012, plans for a 6,300-bed resort village with more than 20 ski lifts were given the green light by then-premier Christy Clark's Liberal government.  The same year the government also controversially amended the Local Government Act to allow Jumbo Glacier Mountain Resort to become a municipality, even though it has no residents. The move ensured developers would receive an annual provincial grant of $260,000 and $50,000 in federal gas tax money. But in 2015, the same government cancelled the resort's environmental certificate after finding hardly any work had been done and the project ""had not been substantially started.""   Last year, the B.C. Court of Appeal upheld that decision. Federal Environment Minister Johnathan Wilkinson says turning the site into a protected area is part of a broader reconciliation agenda the Liberal government has with Indigenous people. ""This has been the subject of lots of controversy, including many court cases for many, many years. This is something that assures we are protecting an important local ecosystem,"" he said. Teneese says the boundaries of the protected area haven't been finalized, but it's expected to be half the size of Yoho National Park to the north. ""We don't know what it is going to look like. A big part of the initial work is going to be conversations with people who are going to be impacted by this,"" she said. The federal government will provide $16.1 million and $5 million will come from private donors, including the Columbia Basin Trust, Wyss Foundation, Wilburforce Foundation, Patagonia, and Donner Canadian Foundation.

Smith carried the compassion and dedication he honed as a family physician into politics, according to former Premier Russell MacLellan. ""He cared and he worked until he found a way of getting things done,"" MacLellan said in a telephone interview from his home in Ingonish, N.S. ""And he didn't make a lot of fuss about it."" Smith died this weekend, according to friends. ""He was a marvellous individual,"" MacLellan said. ""A gentleman to the core."" Premier Stephen McNeil echoed that sentiment in an email to Liberal Party supporters Monday. ""His family has lost a husband, father and grandfather,"" wrote McNeil. ""Nova Scotians have lost a kind and compassionate gentleman. ""On a personal note, I am grateful for his guidance in my early years in Opposition and for his continued support for the last 12+ years."" One of only six Liberals to win in the 1984 election, John Buchanan's largest of four PC majorities, Smith's introduction to Nova Scotia politics was as an opposition member. He sat on the opposition side of the House for the first of his almost two decades at the legislature as the representative of Dartmouth East. When the Liberals took power under John Savage's leadership, Smith was assigned his first major cabinet portfolio, minister of community services. He later took over the job of minister of housing and municipal affairs. But it was during the MacLellan years that Smith got his most challenging jobs, heading the Health Department and briefly carrying on the duties of justice minister. When the Liberals lost government in 1999, Smith was named caucus chair, a position he held until he left politics in 2003. In 2000, Smith joined the medical research firm MedMira, a Halifax-based company best known for its HIV test kits.  Company CEO Hermes Chan said he and Smith traveled throughout the world marketing the kit and other MedMira products. ""Everyone that he met loved him,"" Chan said of his one-time vice-president of communications. That affection was shared by company employees, according to Chan.  ""Internally, our staff called him uncle Jim,"" Chan said. ""He was a very likable guy but he's also [a man of] principal. ""If he believed, he believed till the end."" Smith retired from the company and stepped down from MedMira's board of directors in 2011.

34,Kenneth Miller,2020-01-18T11:00:00.741Z,A husband pleads for the rights of wife with disabilities,"When I married my wife, Cheryl Miller, I promised to be loyal to her through sickness and in health.  She is my love and soulmate, whom I love dearly.  Unfortunately Cheryl has multiple sclerosis, and has lived with this disease for 45 years.  During this time, I have therefore become an advocate for my precious love — and for all disabled individuals.  Why?  Because they have to spend all their energy trying to live a rewarding life, with many challenges and worries ahead of them.  Many, including Cheryl, meet these challenges with great fortitude and bravery. Therefore it is incumbent on me that I continue to fight for changes that will make their lives better.  What are some of the challenges I see and changes that I would like to see?  Nothing is more frustrating than when I can't find a handicapped parking space — especially when a spot is taken by a vehicle without a handicapped permit.  A painted handicapped parking sign on concrete is useless, because after the first snowfall, it's usually covered up.  What is needed are handicapped signs that are on buildings or above ground.  We also need more of them. A lot more. There are too many places that have a limited number of handicapped parking spots, including close to hospitals!  What's more, these spots are rarely supervised, and offenders are rarely ticketed.  And on the off chance they are ticketed, the fines vary too much. Once we've found a parking spot, things don't get much better.   Many places have no ramps to get to the entrance, and often have two sets of doors to go through at a time, or lack automatic doors.  Access to these buildings is therefore extremely difficult.  Some of the doors also have a lip, where a wheelchair might tip over. (It doesn't take much.) Entrances and sidewalks are often uneven and dangerous.  Many beaches are inaccessible, in my opinion, because of little or no regard for the disabled. At least the beach at Birds Hill Provincial Park has beach access mats, but their handicapped trail cannot be safely travelled in a wheelchair!  Oh well, another battle for me to engage in.  Now let's compare Canada to the United States and their Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991. In it, there are clear federal requirements for accessible parking. What's more, states can also create further requirements and enforcement measures. These requirements also are enforced by local law officials instead of private parking authorities. Cheryl and I have been fortunate to vacation in Maui for several years and we don't think we've seen an individual illegally park in a handicapped zone. We also always find a handicapped parking spot, even when tourism is at its highest. Possible reasons? The signs in Maui state the fines associated with the offence. For example, my wife and I noticed handicapped signs that say ""HANDICAPPED PERMIT REQUIRED MAXIMUM FINE $500."" Furthermore, Cheryl and I witnessed handicapped parking spaces regularly being supervised in Maui.  And unlike here, these parking requirements are enforced by local law officials — the Maui police — instead of private parking authorities. Also, all of their signs are above ground where they are easy to see.  Does the United States ensure better care for the disabled than Canada?  When it comes to accessibility, in my opinion, the answer is a resounding ""YES.""  I have talked to different government agencies and officials about implementing changes to make the lives of disabled individuals easier. It has been a never-ending battle with many obstacles, but one that I will gladly continue.  My God, Canadians with disabilities have enough challenges to contend with every day! On a final note, we have an aging population, which, realistically, could mean an increase of disabled individuals.  What we need are far-sighted and compassionate women and men, who can empathise with the disabled community.  In fact, I invite them to live a day … no, a month … no, a year, with the challenges my wife and I have to contend with.  Until the people in power make the necessary changes to make the lives of individuals with disabilities better, the quest will continue for their human (God-given) rights!  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

However, the archeological firm that unveiled its find to the public to much fanfare is standing its ground about that discovery. Excavation work at a site on Sainte-Ursule Street in Old Quebec uncovered a wooden stockade in the fall of 2018. The stockade's location coincided with historical evidence found on a map, dating back to 1700, which shows the Beaucours palisade was built in the same spot. At a November 2018 news conference to present the findings, they were described as ""a major discovery"" by Premier François Legault. But an analysis of two pieces of wood from the structure done recently at Université Laval has called into question the theory that they're part of the first fortifications, suggesting the structure may not date all the way back to 1693. Geography Prof. Martin Simard did a dendrochronological analysis — which dates the wood based on its tree rings — and found ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that one sample dated back to 1751 and the other to 1775. ""Frankly, our results surprised us. We weren't expecting that at all,"" Simard said. ""Considering the strength of the message that the wall dated back to 1693, we were extra careful. We checked and double-checked to be sure."" Simard's report was included as part of a 326-page document the archeology firm Ruralys submitted to the Quebec Ministry of Culture in early January. The executive director of Ruralys, Dominique Lalande, said she was surprised to see this small section of the report spark such debate over the weekend, after it was reported by Radio-Canada. ""Specific analysis isn't always consistent with other archeological data,"" she said. Lalande said the full report included historical maps and ground analysis, as well radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the trees that were chopped down to make the wooden beams. The carbon tests, carried out in a laboratory in Miami, Fla., indicated the trees were cut down during the 17th century, in tune with the conclusion reached by Ruralys. Asked about the discrepancy between the carbon-dating report and his findings, Simard said the dendrochronological analysis is far more precise and was, in fact, used by scientists in the development of carbon-14 dating to calibrate the carbon-dating method and check its accuracy. Lalande said the science of archeology takes into account a combination of findings and data before going with one theory. In this case, she said, there isn't any doubt in her mind the structure was indeed the Beaucours palisade. Josué Dubois Berthelot de Beaucours, a French military engineer, drew the plans for the wooden fortifications built in 1693-94, designed to protect the colony from heavy artillery and cannon balls. William Moss, who worked for Quebec City as chief archeologist for more than 30 years, pointed out that wall was replaced by stone fortifications in 1745. Not directly involved in the research, he was nonetheless glad to see a ""very enthusiastic, positive response"" from politicians in 2018, when the announcement was made. But holding a news conference, attended by the premier, the mayor and other officials before the final report was ready, was ""hasty,"" he said. ""You have to do your analysis before you start putting information like that out."" Lalande said the timing of the announcement was decided by the Ministry of Culture.  The final report submitted to the ministry has been ""reviewed and approved,"" said ministry spokesperson Émilie Mercier. ""Everything leads us to believe it is indeed the Beaucours palisade,"" Mercier told CBC News. The wooden structure is currently in the hands of the ministry's conservation centre in Quebec City, where the wood is undergoing a controlled drying process. Mercier said no decision has been made about what will be done with it. In 2018, Mayor Régis Labeaume called the discovery ""huge"" because it ""reinforces our status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,"" but he had little to say Monday about the contradictory evidence. ""Honestly, I have enough things on my plate,"" said Labeaume. ""I won't get involved.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-fortification-palisade-discovery-1.5432526,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/archeologists-quebec-city-325-year-old-wooden-fortifications-1.4893781 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/irish-grave-site-montreal-black-rock-1.5379413,/news/canada/montreal/archeologists-quebec-city-325-year-old-wooden-fortifications-1.4893781 /news/canada/montreal/irish-grave-site-montreal-black-rock-1.5379413 /news/canada/montreal/saint-henri-leather-tannery-turcot-exhibition-1.4857692 /news/canada/montreal/archeology-dig-artifacts-quebec-city-huron-wendat-history-1.4764246 /news/canada/montreal/carricks-shipwreck-remains-1.5166478
38,Anonymous,2020-01-17T23:38:47.467Z,U.S. to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airports,"The United States will begin screening at three major airports people coming from central Chinese city of Wuhan for the newly-identified coronavirus that has killed two people and infected at least 40 more in China, public health officials said on Friday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening for direct arrivals at New York City's JFK International Airport is expected later Friday followed by screenings on Saturday at San Francisco International Airport. The third airport is Los Angeles International Airport. The risk from the coronavirus to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. While the U.S. State Department has issued a health alert update about travel to the Wuhan region, the CDC has urged citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said on Friday it will not implement extra screening measures, but is ""monitoring the situation closely with our partners on both sides of the border."" The CBSA did say there are plans in progress ""to implement signage"" in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal airports to raise awareness of the virus to travellers. Elsewhere, Thailand has found a second case of a new Chinese coronavirus, authorities said on Friday, as they ramped up checks on Chinese visitors, nearly a million of whom are expected for Lunar New Year holidays next week. The latest patient is from China's central city of Wuhan, which has reported 41 cases of pneumonia potentially linked to the new type of virus, with two deaths, as hospitals worldwide scramble to guard against any spread. The 74-year-old woman, quarantined since arriving in Thailand on Monday, was found to be infected, health officials said. ""We're very confident that we can control the spread of this kind of diseases,"" Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, adding that the situation was under control and there was no outbreak in Thailand. ""We're fully alert."" The two Chinese patients were now safe but needed to go through a few more procedures before Thai authorities could let them return home, he added. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thailand, which is on high alert ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, said on Monday it had found a 61-year-old Chinese woman carrying a strain of the coronavirus, the first time it was detected outside China. Japan reported its first case of the infection on Thursday, after a Japanese man returned from visiting Wuhan, known for picturesque lakes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the virus could spread and warned hospitals against it. Thai health officials have stepped up monitoring at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan — Suvarnabhumi, Don Muang, Chiang Mai and Phuket — and others that receive charter flights from the Chinese city. Since Jan. 3, Thailand has screened 13,624 passengers. Health officials also asked Thai AirAsia and China Southern Airlines, which run direct daily flights from Wuhan, to halt boarding by those suffering from high fever and respiratory symptoms, and reschedule their flights. The CBSA says there are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 /news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619

Nurses' Union ,"Island nurses are calling for answers following a series of resignations and staff changes at the P.E.I. Nurses' Union. The vice-president, treasurer and secretary all resigned days apart in mid-December leaving only Mona O'Shea, president, on the executive board. There has also been a turnover in two of the top jobs at the nurses union, the executive director and a communications officer.  Nurses circulated a formal request calling for a special meeting to deal with the concerns over the resignations and staff changes. That meeting was held Wednesday night. More than 200 nurses were in attendance. More attended by conference call. The nurses union represents more than 1,200 nurses. Zellah Johnston, who served as secretary of the P.E.I. Nurses' Union until she resigned last month, said she had hoped some of her concerns would have been addressed during the members-only meeting. But she said nurses left the meeting feeling even more frustrated.  ""I have lost confidence in the president and the current board,"" said Johnston, who has been a member of the nurses union for more than four decades.  ""It's unfortunate. It's really upsetting to all of our members to feel like this is where we landed."" CBC News reached out to the two other executive members who resigned but did not receive comment. CBC News has not been able to pinpoint what issues are in dispute. In an emailed statement to CBC News, Mona O'Shea, president of the P.E.I. Nurses' Union, said, ""As a democratic organization, we understand that differences of opinion are bound to arise — that healthy and respectful debates are par for the course.""  The statement went on the say, ""We will continue to find solutions to address the nursing shortage, improve workplace conditions and protect Canada's public health-care system."" The P.E.I. Nurses' Union continues to operate with an interim executive.  Andrea Greenan, an RN at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown, said she shares Johnston's concerns. ""The PEINU is in chaos right now and the membership is very concerned about how well the best interest of the RNs and NPs are being represented at this level,"" she said. CBC News talked to several nurses across P.E.I. who expressed similar concerns to that of Johnston and Greenan. CBC News also reached out to the former executive director and former communications officer. Neither wanted to do an interview. None of the current board members CBC News reached would comment. Johnston said the next step is up to the members. But she said the public has a reason to be concerned. ""If the nurses' office is in disarray, then the office is not able to deal effectively with the concerns of the nurses at the bedside and if nurses have concerns at the bedside then that ultimately affects patient care."" Health Minister James Aylward said he was not aware of what was happening within the nurses union.

42,Anonymous,2020-01-16T22:16:13.436Z,Dating apps like Grindr and Tinder are sharing 'really sensitive' data: report ,"Read Story Transcript Dating apps like Grindr, OkCupid and Tinder are sharing users' personal information — including their locations and sexual orientations — with potentially hundreds of shadowy third-party companies, a new report has found.  The Norwegian Consumer Council, a government-funded non-profit organization, said it found ""serious privacy infringements"" in its analysis of online ad companies that track and profile smartphone users. ""I think we should be really worried because we've uncovered really pervasive tracking of users on our mobile phones, but at the same time uncovered that it's really hard for us to do anything about it as individuals,"" Finn Myrstad, the council's digital policy director, told As It Happens host Carol Off. ""Not only do you share [your data] with the app that you're using, but the app is in turn sharing it with maybe hundreds of other companies that you've never heard of."" The group commissioned cybersecurity company Mnemonic to study 10 Android mobile apps. It found that the apps sent user data to at least 135 different third-party services involved in advertising or behavioural profiling. When it comes to dating apps, that data can be extremely personal, Myrstad said. It can include your sexual orientation, HIV status, religious beliefs and more.  ""We're really talking about really sensitive information,"" he said. ""That could be, for example, one dating app where you have to answer a questionnaire such as, 'What is your favourite cuddling position?' or if you've ever used drugs, and if so, what kind of drugs — so information that you'd probably like to keep private."" And that's just the information users are giving over willingly, he said. There's also another level of information that companies can extrapolate using things like location tracking. ""If I spend a lot of time at a mental-health clinic, it can reveal my mental state, for example,"" he said.  Because people don't know which companies have which information, he says there's no way to be sure what it's being used for. Companies could build user profiles and use those for nefarious or discriminatory purposes, he said, like blocking people from seeing housing ads based on demographics, or targeting vulnerable people with election disinformation. ""You can be ... triggered to, say, take up consumer debts or mortgages that are bad subprime purchases, payday loans and these sort of things because companies know about your vulnerabilities, and it's easier to target you because your clicks are tracked and your movements are tracked,"" he said.  People who use Grindr — an app that caters exclusively to LGBTQ people — could risk being outed against their will, he said, or put in danger when they travel to countries where same-sex relationships are illegal. ""If you have the app, it's a pretty good indication that you're gay or bi,"" he said. ""This can put people's life at risk."" The council took action against some of the companies it examined, filing formal complaints with Norway's data protection authority against Grindr, Twitter-owned mobile app advertising platform MoPub and four ad tech companies. Grindr sent data including users' GPS location, age and gender to the other companies, the council said. Twitter said it disabled Grindr's MoPub account and is investigating the issue ""to understand the sufficiency of Grindr's consent mechanism."" In an emailed statement, Grindr said it is ""currently implementing an enhanced consent management platform ... to provide users with additional in-app control regarding their personal data. ""  ""While we reject a number of the report's assumptions and conclusions, we welcome the opportunity to be a small part in a larger conversation about how we can collectively evolve the practices of mobile publishers and continue to provide users with access to an option of a free platform,"" the company said. ""As the data protection landscape continues to change, our commitment to user privacy remains steadfast."" IAC, owner of The Match Group, which owns Tinder and OkCupid, said the company shares information with third parties only when it is ""deemed necessary to operate its platform"" with third-party apps.  Myrstad says there's a commonly-held belief that people willingly waiver their privacy for the conveniences of modern technology — but he doesn't buy it. ""People are really concerned about their privacy, and they are really concerned about their cybersecurity and their safety,"" he said. But in a modern context, he says people are offered a ""take it or leave it choice"" when it comes to apps, social media and dating services.  ""It's what we call the privacy paradox. People feel that they have no choice, so they sort of close their eyes and they click 'yes,'"" he said. ""So what we're trying to do is to ensure that services have much more layered controls, that sharing is off by default ... so that people can be empowered again to make real choices.""

Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed — $3,000 — to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.  The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime. ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Île-des-Chênes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account."" Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud — all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudsters strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements. Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit says because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves. ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should … be more proactive."" As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone. That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back. ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious."" He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank — which TD wouldn't name — and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate. TD said the fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""  Because it wasn't hard for the fraudster to figure out the answer — the contractor named his wife on his Facebook page — TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank's electronic financial terms and conditions. The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.  Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketing claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,"" so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer. ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.  They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.  In smaller print — or, buried in online agreements — banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.  ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service — which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating."" All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.  Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases: Watch: Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bank reached out to him again.  Trudeau says they have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement. TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it took seven months to resolve the problem.  In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote: ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""  In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen. ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?"" She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard — as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted."" CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January. Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labrèche declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg."" He said financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm."" ""If customers start leaving … that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police."" Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police. ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner."" Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustrating and has changed his online banking habits. He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money — $20 is now his limit. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Here we have a coin of the realm, a five-pound coin in fact, made by The Royal Mint, in the customary fashion,"" said Queen lead guitarist Brian May in a video clip, holding a one ounce silver proof coin. ""On one side we have The Queen [Elizabeth], on the other side we have Queen. This never happened before,"" he said. All British coins and banknotes bear the head of the monarch. The coin, released on Monday, features the band's logo and instruments played by the Queen members: the Bechstein grand piano played by Freddie Mercury for Bohemian Rhapsody, May's Red Special guitar, Roger Taylor's Ludwig bass drum with an early-day Queen crest and John Deacon's Fender Precision Bass. The coin's designer Chris Facey also paid tribute to Bohemian Rhapsody, the band's most celebrated hit, with the keys of the piano on the coin pressed down for the opening notes of the song, The Royal Mint said in a press release. The commemorative coin is available in gold and silver proof, with prices varying from £13 (about $22) for a £5 Brilliant uncirculated coin to £2,020 (about $3,400) for the one-ounce gold proof coin. The Queen coin is the first release in The Royal Mint's upcoming ""Music Legends"" series.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/queen-coin-commemorative-1.5433059,[],/news/entertainment/queen-fan-cover-videos-1.5334985 /news/entertainment/bohemian-rhapsody-queen-sales-soar-1.5192264
47,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-11-28T19:42:49.629Z,Customers file record number of complaints about Canadian telcos,"David Marco has no shortage of unflattering adjectives for Bell Canada — a telecom service provider he says convinced him to sign on as a customer by misrepresenting the true cost of a two-year deal for internet, TV and home phone. ""It's outrageous. It's patently wrong. It's deceptive,"" Marco, 65, told Go Public from his home in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. In October, he filed a complaint with the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) — and he's got company. According to the industry mediator's annual report, consumers filed a record-breaking number of complaints against Canada's telecom companies in 2018-19 — nearly 19,300.  The CCTS says that figure is a 35 per cent increase over 2017-18 and an all-time high in the organization's 12-year history.  ""It's disappointing to see … issues that customers shouldn't have to deal with,"" said CCTS Commissioner Howard Maker. ""It tells us that there's still room for improvement."" The report, released Thursday, tracks complaints received between Aug. 1, 2018 and July 31, 2019, of which the greatest share (over 40 per cent) were billing errors, followed by contract disputes (over 30 per cent) and dissatisfaction with service delivery (over 20 per cent).  CCTS says it ""successfully resolved"" 91 per cent of all concluded complaints. Bell Canada, the country's largest telecom, with 22 million subscriptions, received the most complaints — almost 5,900. (A customer with multiple services from the same provider can be associated with several subscriptions.) Complaints against Bell about incorrect charges and ""disclosure of important information"" were ""disproportionately high,"" according to the report.  A Bell spokesperson notes the company's share of total complaints declined slightly over the previous year, and that it is reviewing the report to ""ensure that they continue to provide customers with the best experience.""  Rogers, which has about 16 million subscriptions, received just over 1,800 complaints. Its share of complaints also slightly decreased over the previous year.  Rogers had a ""disproportionately high percentage"" of complaints about incorrect charges on wireless accounts, but received a slightly lower proportion of complaints about credits and refunds that weren't received on internet services.  A Rogers spokesperson said the company had the fewest complaints per subscriber among the national carriers and has ""started to see progress"" in improving its customer service. Telus, with 14.5 million subscribers, received just over 1,600 complaints — up 71 per cent.  Most of those were about either changes to wireless contracts (28 per cent) or wireless price increases (30 per cent), according to the report. It received a lower proportion of complaints about incorrect wireless charges and contract disputes. ""Shame on us that we had language that was confusing and not transparent,"" Tony Geheren, executive VP at Telus, told Go Public. He says the increase in complaints was a result of a ""poorly executed rate change"" for wireless customers and that Telus has since simplified its contracts.  The report notes 158 violations of the Wireless Code — a 42 per cent increase. Most involved a failure of companies to provide customers with key documents, and not giving proper notice before disconnecting a customer's service. Bell accounted for 29 per cent of all Wireless Code breaches, while Rogers and Telus each accounted for 20 per cent.  Marco's frustration began last March, when he says a Bell sales representative promised him internet, TV and home phone service for $119.90 a month for two years. But in September, the price for his TV service went up by $3.50. When he called Bell, he recorded the conversation, and a second rep told him to look at the contract the company emailed him after he verbally agreed to sign up — it mentions that prices are ""subject to change."" Marco says he didn't scrutinize the contract, because he was going with what the first rep offered him on the phone. He requested a transcript of that conversation but was told that wasn't possible.  ""There will be no way for us, sir, to send you a copy of the transcript,"" the rep said. Marco says that's nonsense. ""The contract was the phone call. They're denying that they have the contract,"" he said.  He says a story reported by Go Public last year supports his argument — a case that went to small claims court determined that a verbal agreement between a customer and Bell trumps any written contract that the telecom giant emails after the fact. CCTS investigated but said it couldn't help, because according to Bell the transcript no longer existed. The company only holds them for six months which, according to a Bell spokesperson, is ""standard practice"" in the industry. ""I think that's problematic,"" said Maker, the head of the CCTS.  ""We've spent a lot of time asking the CRTC … to ensure that service providers are retaining records so that an independent investigation can be obtained and the actual facts can be determined."" ""The ability to … investigate what happened is limited in the absence of that phone call."" Consumer advocate John Lawford says what's really needed is a ban on price increases for internet and TV during the life of a contract — the same way companies aren't permitted to jack up prices during a cellphone contract. ""The Wireless Code doesn't let you change your wireless pricing for two years,"" Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, told Go Public. ""It kind of sets the trap for consumers who are expecting the same protections on internet and TV as they have on their wireless phone."" He says the CRTC missed a ""golden opportunity"" when it created similar rules for internet service, which come into effect on Jan. 31.  ""They allowed the Internet Code to go into effect without the rule that you have to keep the price the same,"" says Lawford. ""It is a very big missed opportunity."" Lawford doesn't think the telco giants will lock in prices for internet and TV contracts unless the regulator demands it. He says people fed up with ""unfair"" contracts should complain to the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and their MP.  ""Put pressure on those powers that be — to make the rules for internet and TV the same as they are for as they are for wireless,"" says Lawford.  Meantime, Marco says he will find another provider when his two-year contract is over. For now, he has advice for anyone calling a telecom.  ""Record the conversation. Record anything — incoming and outgoing,"" he says. ""Because it's the only protection that they'll get.""

On Friday, CBC published a letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the N.W.T., which alleged child protection workers had verbally abused and, in some cases, intentionally misled foster parents about children in their care. In subsequent interviews with CBC, foster parents described the department failing to take responsibility for children in their care going missing, or follow up on serious allegations of abuse. The letter was first sent to Health Minister Diane Thom Monday evening by the Foster Family Coalition. She responded with a generic email pointing to the department's progress in completing a self-imposed three-year improvement plan, and making no mention of the letter or its allegations. On Tuesday, CBC requested an interview with Thom. She issued no statement until Friday, when a four-line statement attributed to the minister said she ""will not comment on [the concerns raised] until we have a chance to … hear directly from [the coalition] and build dialogue going forward."" ""Making sure that children and youth in care are safe and supported is something we take very seriously,"" the statement read. Tammy Roberts, the executive director of the Foster Family Coalition, confirmed the department reached out to her Wednesday to arrange a meeting. She said no date had yet been set. Reached by phone on Friday, Premier Caroline Cochrane said she had ""been running non-stop"" and had not read coverage of the letter. ""I do know that if you're talking about the foster family association [sic] than that would be a better question to ask the appropriate minister … Diane Thom,"" she said. While deferring specifics to the department, Cochrane went on to say that ""the government cares."" ""Actions are taking place,"" she said. ""However, the world does not change in a short time."" Asked what she would say to foster parents, Cochrane, a former social worker, said she ""value[s] the support that they provide to children and to our communities. ""I hear that they want to have a voice, and this government is more focused on giving all stakeholders a voice,"" she said.

49,Colin McPhail,2020-01-21T02:29:44.596Z,Saint John seeking private operator interested in taking over TD Station,"The City of Saint John is prepared to hear from private operators interested in buying or leasing the TD Station arena. The request for expressions of interest, issued Monday, comes as the city reviews its assets and operations to alleviate the financial burden on the municipal government. The 16-page document states it's not a call for tenders but instead an opportunity ""to identify possible partners who are interested in either leasing and operating or purchasing and operating TD Station as a major events facility through a mode that is economically sustainable and benefits the Greater Saint John Region."" It states the city will consider ""all types of possible partnerships."" ""There are a number of potential types of partnerships whereby the importance of the facility to the Region could be protected but perhaps with reduced overall costs,"" Saint John Mayor Don Darling said in a release Monday, ""At this point, we are in the early exploratory stages to find out what they might be. Deliberations and a decision to proceed with any interested party will only be made once options are explored and City staff report to Common Council with a business case."" Proponents will be evaluated on the ability to operate a major events facility and develop a business plan demonstrating long-term sustainability. The city said any interested parties must keep the 6,600-seat, city-owned facility as a sports and entertainment venue. The deadline for submissions is Feb. 14.  ""Selling it, leasing it, I'm prepared to look at everything,"" Coun. Donna Reardon told CBC News on Monday evening. ""I think it's a reasonable thing for the city to do, to at least look at those options."" Facing anticipated $10-million deficits in 2021 and 2022, the city embarked on a restructuring campaign to overhaul its finances. One part of the plan is to reduce its commitments to five city-owned regional facilities, including TD Station. For more than 20 years, the cost of operating the facilities has been shared with Quispamsis, Rothesay and Grand Bay-Westfield, with Saint John picking up two-thirds of the tab and all capital costs.  ""I guess we're at crossroads where we say, 'That really isn't a model that's working for us, so how do we either change the model or where do we go from here,'"" Reardon said. In November, the province introduced legislative amendments that would see 12 other surrounding communities chip in up to $470,000 toward operating costs, starting this year, with capital costs being added on in 2021. Reardon said it's unclear just yet how those amendments could be affected by handing TD Station to a private operator. Asked if the restructuring plan could result in more requests for expressions of interest on other city assets, Reardon said it's a possibility. ""Everything is going to be looked at; every rock is going to be overturned,"" she said. ""It's time, for one thing. If we're going to spend wisely, you can't ignore that."" Reardon said the city has to consider if it's the best operator of such a venue — a sentiment shared by the mayor. ""The private sector has a proven track record of handling large-scale facilities like TD Station very successfully in communities across Canada,"" Darling said. ""For the benefit of Saint John, we want to know if the same type of partnership could work here."" TD Station, formerly known as Harbour Station, opened in 1993 and has hosted a number of major events, including the World Curling Championships, the East Coast Music Awards, and often hosts renowned musicians and comedians.  It's also home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and previously hosted the Saint John Riptide before the National Basketball League of Canada franchise announced last summer it was taking a sabbatical to restructure its finances. The expression of interest document advised proponents of two five-year agreements that run until 2024 — one with the Sea Dogs and the other with TD Bank for the naming rights.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/td-station-saint-john-purchase-lease-private-operator-1.5434106,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/budget-assessment-growth-property-tax-rate-service-cuts-municipal-1.5384937 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-budget-arenas-1.5403885 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-regional-facilities-operation-costs-outlying-communities-1.5366884 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/harbour-station-new-name-sea-dogs-1.5247169,/news/canada/new-brunswick/budget-assessment-growth-property-tax-rate-service-cuts-municipal-1.5384937 /news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-budget-arenas-1.5403885 /news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-regional-facilities-operation-costs-outlying-communities-1.5366884 /news/canada/new-brunswick/harbour-station-new-name-sea-dogs-1.5247169
50,Steve Thomas,2019-12-14T09:00:00.675Z,"Careful, Canada: What Ireland has learned about two-tier health care","This column is an opinion by Steve Thomas, director of the Centre for Health Policy and Management at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. He has been studying the issue of privatization in Canada, is the author of a chapter on Canadian health care in the book 'Is Two-Tier Health Care the Future?,' and has collaborated with the University of Toronto and University of Ottawa. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Be careful what you wish for, Canada. One way or the other, Canadian courts are about to make some key decisions about the role of private financing and practice in the health care system; the Cambie case in British Columbia is just the latest attempt to overturn fundamental components of publicly funded medicare.  Closing arguments were made last week and the decision in this legal case, which is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, will have ramifications for decades and for millions of people. So, what can international experience teach us? One particularly illuminating case is Ireland. It is striking that as Canada seems on the cusp of embracing two-tier health care, Ireland is struggling to limit it. In 1957, the Irish Republic decided to set up a voluntary health insurer owned by the state to take the pressure off the public system, allowing health care to be bought by those who had the means. It sounded reasonable, and 60 years later, private health insurance has taken off with almost half the population covered and plans offered by private companies. This allows faster access to public care subsidized by the state, and queue-jumping of the very long waiting lists by those who are better off financially. Despite only accounting for 12 per cent of total health funds, however, private insurance in Ireland now drives access to hospital care – the tail that wags the dog. Private health insurance occupies a unique role in the Irish setting, providing faster access to care in both public- and private-provider settings. However, it does not always cover hospital expenses and often covers a fraction or nothing at all for non-hospital care, such as outpatient appointments with a specialist, GP visits, and care from allied health professionals. It also does not cover drug costs (there is a government reimbursement threshold for households spending more than a fixed amount in a month). Moreover, the benefits of queue jumping only accrue to those who are able to afford private health insurance premiums — and there are concerns about that affordability. The cost of insurance varies hugely by product and there are more than 300 hospital plans, but for an adult with public and private hospital coverage, the cheapest is around $1,900 per year. A recent study showed that roughly 19 per cent of households experience unaffordable private health expenditures, which includes both private health insurance and co-payments. The latest household survey suggests that people are going without some GP services and dental care in order to afford health insurance plans. Ireland has historically been way off the pace when it comes to delivering universal health care. It is an outlier in Europe, with one of the highest proportions of national income spent on voluntary health insurers — 13 per cent in 2017, compared to an EU average of 2 per cent. The result is two-tier access to acute care, and only very average results in terms of health outcomes. (The other two countries with large voluntary health insurance sectors are France and Slovenia, but their insurers cover co-payments and they do not allow faster access). Rather than helping the public sector out, private insurance may have contributed to its problems in Ireland. It erodes solidarity, giving the well-off a way out of engaging with the public sector, and potentially aggravating under-funding by making the better-off less willing to be taxed more for health. It also means that dual-practice providers – those who work in both the public and private sectors — have an incentive to keep their public waiting lists long to boost their private practices. Private insurance also costs every taxpayer regardless of their insurance status, because the government subsidizes those who take out private insurance by offering tax breaks. As a potential way out of this two-tier system, the Fine Gael Labour government of 2011 proposed Irish private insurers become the basis of a universal health insurance system, modelled on the Dutch managed competition system. However, this policy cul-de-sac proved too expensive and too complex, and it has now been abandoned for a more typical re-energizing of the public system in the guise of the ""Sláintecare"" policy. The core aims of Sláintecare are to establish a universal, single-tier health service where patients are treated solely on the basis of health need and funded through general taxation. This means a removal of private insurance funding from public hospitals over a period of six years, with waiting-time guarantees backed up by increased accountability and information. In other words, a return to publicly funded health care. Nevertheless, the disentangling of the public and private systems is complicated; it will take careful planning, coalition-building, and changing the public narrative about the nature of the health system. The introduction of private health insurance in Ireland allowed a two-tier system to develop with long waiting lists in the public system and limited financial protection for households. It has impeded a fair, efficient and integrated system, and there has been profiteering by some insurers since the liberalization. It has taken decades to develop a plan that will disentangle public and private health care financing in Ireland. Implementation will take another 10 years at least. While Canada might be considering an expanded role for private health services and insurance, such a decision needs to be taken with sober judgment. It cannot be easily unwound.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-two-tier-health-care-canada-ireland-1.5383995,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgery-centre-trial-1.5363013 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/closing-arguments-begin-in-legal-case-over-private-health-care-in-b-c-1.5364329 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/surgery-wait-times-alberta-shandro-reduce-1.5390893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/extremely-concerned-protesters-decry-ontario-health-care-cuts-changes-1.5354513 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lawrencetown-cooperative-doctor-recruitment-telehealth-maple-out-of-pocket-1.5138483,/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgery-centre-trial-1.5363013 /news/canada/british-columbia/closing-arguments-begin-in-legal-case-over-private-health-care-in-b-c-1.5364329 /news/canada/british-columbia/private-health-care-is-all-about-doctor-profits-federal-lawyer-tells-b-c-court-1.5373269

Pandya is among a growing contingent of researchers working on new technology that would allow humans to colonize the martian world. The Edmonton-based physician is serving as an astronaut on the red planet from the heart of the desert lands of the western United States. Pandya is acting as the commander of a 16 day mission at the Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville, Utah. The mission officially began on Jan. 18. She will ""return to Earth"" on Feb. 3.  ""We're going to be living real life on fake mars,"" Pandya said in an interview Friday with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. ""We're essentially living in a tin can."" The research station simulates life on Mars so researchers can study the science needed for human exploration of the planet. ""We're locked in, not locked in,"" she said.  ""You have to suit up to go outside because going outside would essentially kill you so that's the biggest adjustment.""  Pandya and her crew will be contending with all the complications of life in a hostile environment. The atmosphere on Mars is barren and deadly. Radiation is high. Oxygen is virtually nonexistent. Her water supply will be limited. Her meals will be freeze-dried or grown in an enclosed greenhouse on site. Communication with Earth will be limited.  ""In the past we've grown tomatoes and basil and thyme so there is a little bit of an opportunity for fresh food on Mars,"" she said.  ""And then you also maintain the time delays with Earth so, at its maximum that's a one way 20 minute communication delay, so you can imagine that nothing like phone calls or Skype or instant messaging is possible.""  This is Pandya's second mission at the research station and part of a growing resume in space research and bioastronautics.  Pandya, who grew up in Sherwood Park, and earned two degrees at the University of Alberta, is an advanced diver, skydiver, pilot-in-training, and Fellow of the Explorers' Club. In 2015 she successfully completed Scientist-Astronaut Candidate training with Project PoSSUM (Polar Suborbital Science in the Upper Mesosphere) and was part of the first crew to test a commercial spacesuit in zero-gravity; She most recently completed an underwater mission with Nautical Experiments in Physiology, Technology & Underwater Exploration (NEPTUNE) for scientific research.

52,Sophia Harris,2020-01-17T09:00:00.585Z,'I'm appalled': Lawyers alarmed as Ottawa gives more powers to U.S. border officers at Canadian airports,"Concerns are mounting over added powers Ottawa has granted U.S. customs officers to strip-search, question and detain U.S.-bound travellers — on Canadian soil. The changes are part of Canada's new preclearance act, which the federal government says will enhance border security and make travel to the U.S. easier. But Pantea Jafari, an Iranian-Canadian immigration lawyer, fears it could make travel more difficult for her. That's because the act gives U.S. customs officers in Canada broader interrogation powers — at a time when the U.S. has toughened its stance on immigration and has increasingly hostile relations with Iran. ""I will not allow a border officer to have access to me and have unfettered right to question me to no end,"" said Jafari, who's based in Toronto and serves many Iranian clients.  Since the preclearance act took effect in August, she has stopped travelling to the U.S. and says the country's current standoff with Iran has only strengthened her resolve.  ""My concerns of going to the U.S. have now 100 times increased."" Canada's new preclearance act overrides a previous agreement with the United States that allowed travellers to clear U.S. customs in preclearance zones at Canadian airports, before flying across the border. Eight major Canadian airports already have preclearance areas — and the new act paves the way for more zones involving all modes of transport. Proponents say preclearance offers many benefits, including allowing Canadians to clear U.S. customs in their own country. ""They land in the U.S. as a domestic passenger, so you don't have to go through long lineups,"" said Gerry Bruno, co-chair of the Beyond Preclearance Coalition, an industry group supporting efficient Canada-U.S. border travel.  While they don't dispute the benefits of preclearance, some immigration lawyers claim the new act could jeopardize Canadian rights.  The big concern is that American preclearance officers could now further interrogate Canadians who withdraw their application to enter the U.S., perhaps because they feel uncomfortable during a customs inspection. Previously, law-abiding travellers could simply leave and return home, because they were still on Canadian soil.  Now they could be detained — even handed over to Canadian authorities to face charges — for refusing to answer questions about why they're withdrawing. ""You say, 'I think you're racially profiling me and I'm offended. I don't want to go to your country, I want to leave,'"" said Calgary-based immigration lawyer Michael Greene. ""[U.S. officers are] entitled to examine those reasons and if they think you're not being truthful, they're entitled to detain you."" Jafari said the new rules are especially troubling for racialized populations, such as those of Middle Eastern descent, who could be targeted for questioning.  ""We're the ones that are deemed the threat, right; the domestic threat of some sort that they need to data mine."" Public Safety Canada said the withdrawal rules were revamped to prevent bad actors from probing preclearance zones in search of a weak entry point. ""Allowing a traveller to withdraw without any type of examination creates challenges in terms of border security,"" spokesperson Tim Warmington said in an email. He added that U.S. preclearance officers questioning travellers who opt to withdraw can't ""unreasonably delay"" them. But what constitutes an ""unreasonable"" delay could be open to interpretation, argues Greene. ""When you look at it from the U.S. perspective of wanting to protect the security of the country, that could result in some very extensive questioning,"" he said. Bruno said that law-abiding travellers shouldn't encounter problems at the preclearance zones, and maintains that it beats clearing customs in the U.S., where you ""can't withdraw."" ""You're there. You're subject to U.S. laws,"" he said. U.S. preclearance officers in Canada must follow Canadian laws, including the charter and Human Rights Act. In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made this point when defending the new act — before it had become law.  ""There is extra protection,"" he told The Canadian Press.  However, Canada's privacy commissioner has argued that protection appears to be ""hollow"" due to Canada's State Immunity Act, which grants the U.S. government immunity in most cases. ""A Canadian who believes a U.S. customs official has broken Canadian law has little recourse in the courts,"" states the Office of the Privacy Commissioner's website.  Immigration lawyers are also concerned that under the new act, U.S. preclearance officers can now strip-search Canadian travellers. Public Safety spokesperson Warmington said that U.S. officers must have reasonable grounds to do the search and that it will only happen in rare circumstances ""where Canadian [border] officers are unable to respond or decline."" Immigration lawyer Len Saunders said his concerns with the act are compounded by the fact that some customs officers appear to be getting tougher at U.S. land crossings along the country's northern border. In 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol doled out almost double the number of five-year bans to travellers crossing from Canada, compared to 2018. ""When the Americans are treating Canadians like this on American soil, why would you allow them so much autonomy on Canadian soil?"" said Saunders, whose office sits close to the Canadian border in Blaine, Wash. ""I'm appalled by what the Canadian government has agreed to."" Travellers who feel mistreated can submit feedback to a ""preclearance consultative group"" set up to provide oversight, said Warmington.  He also pointed out that Canadian customs officers will have equal powers in U.S. preclearance zones. Canada currently has no preclearance zones in the U.S., but Warmington said the government is ""exploring the potential.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/preclearance-act-federal-government-u-s-border-1.5429662,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pre-clearance-u-s-travellers-bill-c-23-reaction-1.4213797 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/border-preclearance-bill-trudeau-1.3994264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-border-crossing-rights-1.5382547,/news/politics/pre-clearance-u-s-travellers-bill-c-23-reaction-1.4213797 /news/politics/border-preclearance-bill-trudeau-1.3994264 /news/opinion/opinion-border-crossing-rights-1.5382547

54,Erica Johnson,2019-11-18T16:14:38.413Z,"Bank wires fraudsters over $800K of retiree's savings, despite red flags","A Calgary retiree says he was ""sick to his stomach"" after learning his bank wired more than $800,000 of his savings to fraudsters despite security red flags. Rod McLeod, 75, was a longtime customer with Cidel Bank — one of dozens of private banks in Canada that handle wealth management for people with high incomes or sizeable assets.  ""It has turned my life upside down,"" says McLeod, a retired lawyer. ""I expected them to protect me."" McLeod is suing, alleging ""negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty"" by Cidel in a statement of claim filed last week. It's one more case of what's become a multibillion-dollar problem in Canada and the U.S., according to authorities.  Wire fraud is a ""huge problem"" and ""so rampant,"" investigator and former FBI agent Don Vilfer told Go Public, that better laws are needed in Canada and the U.S. to protect bank customers.  ""Legislation in both Canada and the U.S. is behind in terms of requiring financial institutions to take certain steps … [to prevent] this kind of thing,"" Vilfer said.  In September 2018, McLeod was excited to make an offer on a condo in Rancho Mirage, Calif. — just north of Palm Desert. He had Cidel wire a deposit to a California bank account and waited for instructions on the outstanding balance of $619,000 US ($820,000 Cdn). A few weeks later, an email supposedly from the realtor handling the sale, said the balance should go to a different bank — Chase Bank in Denver, Colo. Even though his escrow agent had cautioned him, two months earlier, against any sudden changes, McLeod says the warning was forgotten in the push to seal the deal.  The seller, he'd been told, was a billionaire. ""So it made sense that he banked in several places."" McLeod sent the new instructions to his contact at Cidel. But the email wasn't from his realtor, Brady Sandahl. It was from a new email address, created by fraudsters who had transposed the last two letters of Sandahl's name so that, at first glance, it appeared legit. When that email arrived at Cidel, it appears the bank's mail server flagged it, tacking ""SUSPICIOUS MESSAGE"" onto the subject line.  Despite that warning, a bank employee emailed the fraudster, asking for the address of the bank account owner — adding a senior Cidel employee and McLeod to the email thread. McLeod says his excitement about the condo got the better of him. He didn't notice the email had been flagged, and, he says, had no prior experience wiring money to another country. ""I don't do this every day. This is something that's totally new to me,"" he said.  ""My wife said, 'You wanted it too much, you ignored the red flags.'""  McLeod and his wife authorized the wire transfer. The money went to Denver, where fraudsters quickly transferred most of it to the Bank of China in Hong Kong. Days later, when McLeod made inquiries about next steps, it became apparent he was the victim of fraud. ""I thought, this can't be happening,"" he says. ""It just can't be happening."" Chase Bank was able to keep $26,000 US from being transferred, and that money was returned to McLeod. McLeod hired Vilfer to investigate. Since leaving the FBI over a decade ago, Vilfer has testified in over 100 cases, often providing expert testimony on digital forensics in cases involving wire fraud. ""It's very profitable for the fraudsters when they can pull it off,"" he says. ""We had one client that lost $14 million — and they're [fraudsters] doing this all day long."" In his report to McLeod, Vilfer says the realtor's email account may have been compromised and recommended further analysis of the realtor's devices and accounts.  ""With email hijacking scams of this type, in my experience, it is the realtor or mortgage broker who is targeted,"" he wrote. Sandahl did not respond to calls for comment from Go Public.  The case is an example of what investigators call ""business email compromise"" — a type of wire fraud that targets businesses and their customers. Typically, the fraudster hacks into a business's email account and impersonates the sender, instructing the customer to redirect the money.  Go Public recently investigated this type of scam, and spoke to a Toronto-area businessman who lost almost $3,000.  Compromised business emails — particularly in the real estate sector — led to an estimated loss of $12 billion US over the past five years, according to the FBI. Such scams were reported in 150 countries, and all 50 U.S. states. Vilfer says McLeod's bank — Cidel — should have stopped the scam in its tracks. ""You have the flag on the email that it's a suspicious message,"" says Vilfer. ""And with this kind of fraud that's so prevalent … that should certainly cause some sort of alarm, to take an extra look at this and see why is this being flagged?"" ""Good technology ... apparently was ignored,"" he said.  In the statement of claim against Cidel, McLeod's lawyer, Brett Code, alleges the bank's actions ""represent a marked departure from the required standard of care, and constitute gross negligence."" It seeks full compensation for McLeod's loss.  None of the allegations has been proven in court and Cidel has not yet responded to the statement of claim.  In one of two emails to McLeod, Cidel CEO Craig Rimer wrote: ""We are very sorry that you've had to go through this terrible experience and for the financial loss you endured."" However, he wrote, Cidel has no obligation to reimburse McLeod.  In a second, one-line email, Rimer blamed McLeod for the wire fraud, writing, ""The introduction to the email address came from you and you authorized the transaction after much back and forth between them [fraudsters] and you."" Rimer declined to be interviewed but sent Go Public a statement saying, ""We acted in accordance with the express written and signed wire instructions that were delivered to us by our client.""  He would not outline what policies exist at the bank when it comes to conducting wire transfers, but wrote that Cidel acted in full compliance with all industry standards and that the bank will continue to assist its client in recovering the funds from ""an unscrupulous third party."" There is no legislation in Canada or the U.S. that requires a financial institution to confirm the identity of a bank account holder who is receiving a wire transfer to prevent fraud and protect customers.   It's considered a best practice for banks to confirm they are sending a client's money to an appropriate destination, but Vilfer — the former FBI agent — thinks that needs to become law.  ""We're just relying on the banks doing the right thing,"" he says. ""It would be a good idea for both the United States and Canada to stiffen up the statutory requirements; require policies for protecting against this sort of fraud."" The largest insurer of U.S. banks, ABA Insurance Services, said recently it's ""critical"" that banks start making phone calls to authenticate wire transfers, among other procedures.  McLeod knows his lawsuit against Cidel could drag on for years. ""If I don't win this, I'm throwing good money after bad,"" he says. ""And they can outlast me. I'm 75 years old."" He's also moved his remaining assets to another management company.

55,"Virginia Smart, Lisa Ellenwood",2019-11-24T09:00:00.590Z,"Pain, agony and 'years of duress': How hockey wives are fighting back over players' chronic brain injuries","Jennifer Belak Liang remembers her car phone ringing as she was picking up her daughters Alex and Andie from school one day in August 2011. It was the agent for her husband, hockey player Wade Belak. On speaker phone, the agent asked her if she had spoken to her husband that day.  She hadn't. It was the second phone call she received asking that question and it filled her with dread.  ""Wade is really hurt,"" the agent said. ""It was awful. I was called by multiple friends … they knew before I knew. But they didn't know what to say,"" Belak Liang said of the day she lost her husband to suicide. Belak's suicide was the third death in a cluster of tragic and sudden deaths of NHL enforcers, including Derek Boogaard, 28, and Rick Rypien, 27. All had been tasked with fighting on ice and all suffered multiple hits to the head. There have been other deaths of players since, including Steve Montador and Todd Ewen. Now, the wives of some of the retired hockey enforcers are in their own fight, taking on the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman. They want the league to acknowledge there's a link between fights and head injuries on the ice and long-term effects like degenerative brain disease. They also want more support for families struggling with symptoms of traumatic brain injury.  ""My husband had CTE. He was showing signs of CTE. He took his own life,"" said Belak Liang. ""It's going to be many more...  It's [an] injustice to everyone else out there, I think, for them not to admit that this can happen.""  Wade Belak had recently retired from his 14-year career with the National Hockey League and was in Toronto in the summer of 2011 rehearsing for the show Battle of the Blades — the CBC reality show that pairs hockey players with figure skaters. At approximately 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, he ended his life. After the loss of her husband, Jennifer Belak Liang struggled with feelings of isolation and guilt.  ""I was drowning, blaming myself,"" she said in an interview with The Fifth Estate. At the time, she knew little of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease. Her husband had asked that in the event of his death, his brain be tested for the disease. She fulfilled his wish, and he was diagnosed with CTE. Since the loss of her husband, Belak Liang, who has since remarried, tries to offer support to others facing tragic loss of loved ones. As an NHL enforcer who played 14 seasons in the NHL, Belak ""knew his role,"" said Belak Liang. ""He didn't love it, but he was fine with it [because] he wanted to stay within the NHL and have his career.  ""He told me: 'I can't stay here unless I fight.' "" Watch Jennifer Belak Liang remember her husband: While many hockey players can make millions during their career, brain trauma and concussions can take a toll, especially for those who played the role of an enforcer — a role now being phased out. It  was during her husband's last years with the Nashville Predators that Belak Liang noticed a shift in his behaviour.   ""It started about five years before he passed. He just got really introverted, really quiet at home. When the kids were screeching or making noises, I could see him not able to handle it, which was not like him."" About eight months before he died, Belak noticed a decline in her husband's memory. He'd use his phone to help remember daily tasks, including taking pictures of groceries he had to buy.   Many experts say concussions can often lead to a cycle of substance abuse, depression, memory loss, even suicide.  Daniel Carcillo, 35, from King City, Ont., has won two Stanley Cups with the Chicago Blackhawks, and was known as Car Bomb for his reckless fighting style on ice. He now battles depression and suicidal thoughts.  Carcillo said his wife, Ela Bulawa, has been burdened. ""But I think that's what marriage and loving somebody is all about, right? Through sickness and in health.""  While he was in his final NHL season with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2015, Carcillo suffered great personal loss: the passing of his grandfather, as well as his best friend and teammate, Steve Montador, who was found to have CTE. Carcillo, who had seven concussions during his NHL career, wonders if he could become another statistic. ""Wade had CTE. Are these reaffirmations that I'm going to have CTE?... ""There's a pretty good chance."" Once retired, players can often feel abandoned and without support. Carcillo said he has felt that way. But he's taken steps to heal: functional neurology therapy, acupuncture, proper nutrition and diet. He speaks publicly, often on social media, about traumatic brain injury and the impact it can have.   ""I'm very, very proud of Daniel, from where he has been, and where he is now,"" Bulawa said. They have started a foundation called Chapter 5, which aims to provide support to retired players and their families, especially players who are suffering post-concussion syndrome, anxiety and depression. ""They put their whole lives into playing hockey and being the best of the best. And once it's over, then what?"" said Bulawa. ""It shouldn't just be,'Oh, that's it, sorry guys. See ya later.' ""   Carcillo and Bulawa have learned to recognize signs of his depression returning, for example sleeping in, impulse control issues, loss of appetite and withdrawal from friends and family. Todd Ewen played hockey in the era when even after getting rocked on the ice, players were sent back out again. Both he and his wife, Kelli, believed he experienced head trauma because he had symptoms: blurry vision, headaches and sleeplessness. After playing 11 seasons in the NHL, Todd Ewen retired in 1997. He became a real estate agent, was a musician, patented several inventions and coached the St. Louis University Billikens. But Ewen was struggling. He became aggressive with Kelli. Depression, memory loss and confusion plagued him. By 2013, he gave up coaching because he couldn't remember plays and was missing practices.   ""We didn't know who we had. One day we had the sad Todd, the mad Todd, the angry Todd. We had no idea what was going on. This man suffered for years like this, our family suffered for years like this,"" his wife said. They wondered if he could have Alzeimher's or Parkinson's disease, but with the loss of Rypien, Boogaard and Belak in 2011, Ewen began to wonder if he could have CTE.  He told Kelli one day that he didn't want to be a burden. At the time, she did not realize the weight of his words. On Sept. 19, 2015, Kelli Ewen found her husband in the basement of their home near St. Louis. He was 49 when he killed himself. The Ewen family was contacted by the Canadian Concussion Centre in Toronto asking to study Todd's brain.   ""I knew something was wrong. And I thought maybe this is the answer. I read the articles about [CTE]. I could just check off the boxes, just one after another. And I thought this has to be it.""  But neuropathologist Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati at the centre told Kelli her husband did not have CTE. She was devastated and desperate for an explanation and said she asked the doctor to retest his brain, but Hazrati declined.  In 2018, a class action lawsuit between more than 300 retired players and the NHL was settled. Players had accused the league of failing to protect them from head injuries or warn them of the risks involved with playing. Ewen's negative CTE results were used as an example in the lawsuit of how media hype could lead a person to kill themselves because of fear of having CTE. Bettman wrote: ""This, sadly, is precisely the type of tragedy that can result when plaintiffs' lawyers and their media consultants jump ahead of the medical community and assert, without reliable scientific support, that there is a causal link between concussions and CTE.""  Kelli Ewen said she was was extremely hurt, and believed they were using her husband for the benefit of the lawsuit.   The NHL announced an $18.9-million US settlement — $22,000 US per player and medical expense coverage up to $75,000 per person. However, there was no acknowledgement of liability for the players' assertions.  Carcillo refused to participate in the settlement.  Kelli Ewen couldn't live with the results from the Canadian Concussion Centre. She arranged to have samples of her husband's brain sent to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist and director of Boston University's CTE Center. Her research, much of which has involved professional athletes, focuses on the long-term effects of all kinds of brain injury, which can include CTE. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed with an autopsy.  While there is no known treatment, the hope is research from Boston University's brain bank will one day allow the detection of the disease in life, ""while there's still a chance to do something about it,"" McKee said. In late 2018, McKee revealed her own conclusions to Kelli Ewen, stating her instincts were correct: her husband did, in fact, have CTE.  ""[Gary Bettman] still stands by the [original] findings, which I find mind-boggling,"" Kelli Ewen said. Kelli Ewen filed a lawsuit against the NHL on April 30, 2019, challenging the league's dismissal of  a link between hits to the head during hockey games and CTE . She wants to bring awareness to concussions and CTE and the suffering families go through when they don't understand the symptoms they're seeing with their husbands.   ""It's not about money, you know? It's about the pain, the agony, the years of duress,"" she said.   ""I feel like it's the NHL's responsibility to stand up and take care of these players that this great game of hockey was built on; these fighters that gave, essentially, their lives for the NHL. And it's time for them to step up and admit and help them get the help they need."" Watch Kelli Ewen talk about her lawsuit: The day after Kelli Ewen's lawsuit was filed, Bettman appeared before a Commons subcommittee in Ottawa regarding sports-related concussions and safety.   Bettman questioned any direct link between multiple hockey concussions and CTE, saying ""in short, I don't believe based on everything I've been told — and if anybody has information to the contrary, we'd be happy to hear it — other than some anecdotal evidence, there has not been that conclusive link."" ""Our players like the way the NHL game is played and understand the implications of playing a physical contact sport at the highest professional level in the world,"" he said.  ""At the end of the day we view ourselves as a family, and our resources are available to the members of our family."" Jennifer Belak Liang, Kelli Ewen and the Carcillo family would disagree.  ""It's crazy to me that they won't admit anything. It's sad,"" Belak Liang said.   ""At least admit it's real,"" said Ewen. ""That would go a long way with a lot of the families."" The Fifth Estate requested an interview with Bettman to address the wives' concerns, but the only response was: ""Thank you for your inquiry. We will not be participating.""   At a sports conference in Toronto last week, The Fifth Estate's Bob McKeown approached Bettman. All he would say was: ""How are you? Nice to see you. I gotta go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hockey-players-enforcers-brain-injuries-1.5370444,[],/sports/hockey/nhl/stan-mikita-suffered-cte-1.5283786 /sports/hockey/nhl/mark-pavelich-miracle-on-ice-assault-concussions-1.5339071 /sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-concussion-bettman-hits-1.5119201 /news/canada/british-columbia/hockey-enforcer-lawsuit-1.4975937
56,Bobby Hristova,2020-01-17T19:22:28.767Z,Hamilton artist sells paintings to save animals from Australian wildfires,"Sandee Ewasiuk has been painting for 30 years, but says sometimes as an artist she struggles to understand ""why we do it"" — for now, WHY is Australia's wildfires. Ewasiuk, 55, who teaches at the Art Gallery of Burlington and the Dundas Valley School of Art, is selling paintings of images she took in Australia with all proceeds going directly to the WIRES Australian Wildlife Rescue Organization.  She started Sunday and says she already raised about $2,000. ""The fires just came up and we had just been there and that's when I realized 'this is it,' "" she tells CBC. ""There's a sense of urgency to this, it's important to do it while people still have it on their mind."" Ewasiuk has lived in the Kirkendall North neighbourhood for 23 years and says she travelled, from September to November in 2019, to Australia in a camper van with her Australian husband and their children. While she was there, she spent time under baby blue skies that met soft sandy dunes — home to kangaroos, wallabies, emus, kookaburras and koala bears. Ewasiuk stood feet away from some of Australia's wildlife, but during her visit she also saw embers burn among the greenery. ""Mostly we saw places that were burned out … it was smouldering still,"" she says. ""We didn't have to drive through the fires because they weren't raging, but Port Macquarie on the east coast was blocked and we couldn't get through."" Ewasiuk downloaded an app on her phone to watch the status of the fires every day. ""We were watching it all the time because we weren't sure we could go,"" she says. Ewasiuk vividly remembers a rude awakening while camping at Coffs Harbour. It was about three in the morning when she woke up to a hazy sky and smell of smoke, despite the nearest fire being 50 kilometres away. While she and her family avoided the fires in Australia, they followed her home. ""We came back home, watching them get worse and worse and worse,"" Ewasiuk says. ""We saw so much wildlife there, we spent time right beside them. For me, it was just, 'oh my god, how do we do anything for this?' Working as a painter, I just thought, 'let's give this a shot.' "" Fire has ravaged the country, scorching forests and suffocating animals, with reports of more than a billion animals killed. Now, Ewasiuk is making mixed-media paintings of pictures she snapped in Australia to raise money for the fight against the fires. Some of the canvases are smaller and others, she says, are life-sized, like her 36 by 60 inch painting of a kangaroo at Mimosa Rocks National Park. ""It's supposed to show the beauty we experienced … with a very colourful background,"" she says. Ewasiuk will also paint emus, kookaburras and koala bears.

57,H.M. Jocelyn,2019-12-21T18:28:28.109Z,Canadians travelling to or through U.S. should pay close attention to their withering rights,"This column is an opinion by H.M. Jocelyn, a Ph.D. candidate in American Studies at Rutgers University-Newark. A dual Canadian-American citizen, she was born in Stratford, Ont., and crosses the international boundary between the two nations many times a year. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. The United States and Canada share what's been known as the longest undefended border in the world, because of the neighbourly sentiment between the nations. Now defence has become irrelevant, because Canadian lawmakers have effectively invited an invasion by U.S. border authorities. In the political climate of President Donald Trump's Muslim ban and Facebook groups comprising bigoted customs agents, Canadians travelling to or through the U.S. need to pay close attention to their withering rights. While far less violent than the horrors at the southern boundary of the United States, problems arising across the northern U.S. line are alarming. Incidents of racial profiling against travellers of colour have risen significantly, and the number of people turned back by U.S. border guards has seen an increase in recent years. The most recent incursion by U.S. border officials comes in the form of amendments made earlier this year to the set of laws that facilitate cross-border movement, known as the Canada-United States Preclearance Agreement. Travellers on their way from Canada into the United States should be aware that these changes, ostensibly enacted to increase the efficiency of travel and trade across the boundary, give U.S. officials dangerously extended power in Customs preclearance areas on Canadian ground (currently found in some Canadian airports). U.S. officials can now carry sidearms in these preclearance zones, conduct strip searches, record and keep passenger information, and detain Canadian citizens. Even if a Canadian official is unwilling to conduct a search or has deemed a detainment unnecessary, a U.S. official can override that call. In other words, Canadian law enforcement can now be countermanded within Canada by Americans. This new authority also allows U.S. border guards to deny Canadians their right of withdrawal. Before the amendment to the law was enacted, if a person felt at all uncomfortable in the course of preclearance questioning, he or she could simply leave, retracting their intention to cross the border with no penalty. Now, as a result of amendments, the guard is entitled to detain a person if ""reasonable grounds"" are found to do so. And the request to leave in itself could be construed as reasonable grounds. As Michael Greene, a Canadian immigration lawyer, puts it: ""they wouldn't be able to walk out. They can be held and forced to answer questions"" — even if the questions are discriminatory. Each new provision in the Preclearance Agreement comes with a similarly vague, deeply troubling caveat. For example, section 10(2) states, ""A preclearance officer is not permitted to exercise any powers of questioning or interrogation, examination, search, seizure, forfeiture, detention or arrest that are conferred under the laws of the United States."" It adds that, ""a preclearance officer must exercise their powers and perform their duties and functions under this Act in accordance with Canadian law, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian Human Rights Act."" However, there are questions about how the Charter would be applied in the case of a dispute, and the agreement contains sections that put some of the limits in question. For example, ""In a preclearance perimeter, a preclearance officer may, for the purpose of conducting preclearance or of maintaining the security of or control over the border between Canada and the United States, direct that a person identify themselves and state their reason for being in the preclearance perimeter; question a traveller bound for the United States; direct a traveller bound for the United States to go to a preclearance area; … examine, search and detain goods."" Another section says, ""A preclearance officer is, if they act on reasonable grounds, justified in doing what they are required or authorized to do under this Act and in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose."" In other words, authoritarian behaviour is prohibited — except as the U.S. deems necessary. The intention of equivocal statements such as these can only be a broader interpretation of the limit (or limitlessness) of American power. Scarier still is the provision that undergirds every amendment to the agreement: that U.S. border officials will not be held accountable for impropriety. In the exact language of the bill, ""no action or other proceeding of a civil nature may be brought against a preclearance officer in respect of anything that is done or omitted in the exercise of their powers or the performance of their duties and functions"" under the legislation. So there will be no repercussions for anything committed in the exercise of their powers. This is a menacing leniency in our era of partisan conflict and rampant xenophobia. Groups such as the Iranian Canadian Congress have expressed concern at these new broad powers, perturbed at their potential: ""With the rise of discriminatory instances against Iranians in both Canada and the United States, and the current political climate between Iran and the two countries, removing the safeguards for withdrawing allows preclearance officers the ability to racially profile Iranian-Canadians with no restrictions or recourse for Iranian-Canadians."" Their worry is understandable, considering the concomitant increases in individual power and instances of racism among U.S. border guards. It cannot be left to the whims and biases of individual U.S. officials to decide what happens to Canadian citizens in Canada. Trump encourages prejudice and discourages international partnership. There is a staggering hypocrisy in building a wall — or a moat full of alligators — at the border to the south, while extending jurisdiction across the border to the north. Under Trump's leadership, any latent intolerance among border-protection agents is given room to roam.

But his father, Wayne Wall, is not losing faith that his son, Josh Wall, 26, will be found alive. ""I'm remaining hopeful. It's another night that he's out there,"" Wayne told CBC News Sunday evening. Bay Roberts RCMP, the Avalon North Wolverines Search and Rescue and a CH149 Cormorant from 9 Wing Gander were all part of the search Sunday, along with an RCMP police dog. The search is expected to resume Monday, though with the added challenge of a weather forecast that shows more snow, up to 15 centimetres, followed by rain showers or drizzle in the morning. ""It is now believed that Joshua may have made it out of the wooded area, where he was walking to get to a friend's home in Marysvale, and back onto Roaches Line,"" an RCMP press release said Sunday. Roaches Line is a village in the area of Conception Bay North. ""Residents in the general area are asked to search their properties, vehicles, sheds and other outbuildings, in the event Joshua sought shelter there.""

A man was seen on Roaches Line yesterday, she said, but it's not been confirmed that it was Wall. The family is distraught, Power said, and concerned for Wall's safety. Anyone who has information is asked to call Bay Roberts RCMP at 709-786-2118. Darkness halted the search for Wall Saturday evening. ""I'm frantic this morning,"" his mother, Nora Wall, told CBC's Terry Roberts on Sunday. Her son has not been heard from since 1 p.m. on Friday, just as the storm was intensifying. Josh went into the woods around 12:30 p.m. on Friday, with plans to walk along a backcountry trail from his family's home on Roaches Line to visit a friend in another Conception Bay community, Marysvale. His parents said Josh has health issues and is prone to panic attacks. He messaged his location in the wilderness to his friend in Marysvale around 1 p.m. on Friday, along with a message saying he was lost and that his phone's battery was low on power, said Wayne Wall, Josh's father.  Wayne said his son was in pain Friday morning and wanted to go to the hospital, but the storm prevented them from travelling. Josh later told his parents he was going to visit a friend in Marysvale, and decided to leave on foot. Josh was wearing a heavy winter jacket and a warm hat, mittens and boots.

61,Paul Tukker,2020-01-18T17:00:00.235Z,They're taking over a small town Alaska newspaper — for $20,"It seemed too good to be true — take over a beloved local newspaper in a scenic small town, for free? Turns out, it wasn't free. It's been sold for $20. ""My accountant said I've got to put some number on the contract,"" said Larry Persily, the soon-to-be-former owner and publisher of the Skagway News in Skagway, Alaska.  ""So, $20 ... I'll get a pizza out if it."" Persily's been running the paper from Anchorage since he bought it a little over a year ago. In November, he decided to pass the torch — and put word out that he wanted to give the whole operation away, for nothing. That news went viral. He heard from people all over Alaska and the rest of the U.S., and Canada. He also heard from interested people in Australia, Israel and Europe. Impressive, considering the paper serves a community of about 1,000 people. ""An amazing number. More than I expected,"" Persily said. He quickly ruled out anybody lacking newspaper or journalism experience. But that still left a good pool of plausible candidates, he said. ""It really came down to just kind of a gut feeling,"" he said. ""I wasn't looking for the Pulitzer Prize-winning greatest journalist in America, I wasn't looking for someone who thought they were going to change the world with investigative reporting, or start doing videos ... I was trying to find someone who I thought was really sincere about wanting to make a life in a small town."" He found them just outside Anchorage, in Chugiak, Alaska. ""We've kind of been on cloud nine, and we couldn't tell anyone for a while,"" said Gretchen Wehmhoff, a part-time teacher and journalist who's now set to take over the Skagway News with her friend Melinda Munson. The two longtime Alaskans were named as the paper's new owners on Friday. Wehmhoff recalls hearing about the gig last fall. ""Melinda actually was the one that talked me into it,"" Wehmhoff recalled. ""And when she first sent me an e-mail, I was like, 'Oh yeah, you're funny.'"" Munson — also a teacher and part-time journalist — wasn't joking. Soon they were huddled in a together in a classsroom putting an application together. ""Why not? There were more reasons to do, than to not do,"" Wehmhoff said.    ""My rule has always been that if somebody gives you a free paper, you say yes,"" laughed Munson. ""I live by that rule."" Wehmhoff calls it a dream job. ""We both love journalism, and we both love serving the community. And for me, I would rather do a small paper versus a large paper,"" she said. ""And I've always wanted to work in journalism where we were our own boss."" ""Amen,"" Munson said.    It's no secret, though — keeping a small-town newspaper afloat these days is tough, and getting tougher. Just ask Persily, who's had a long career in journalism. ""You're seeing it around the country, where newspapers, admitting the challenging economics, are going to nonprofit models or something different than the traditional one ... because it just doesn't work anymore."" Still, he's got faith in Munson and Wehmhoff — that's why he chose them to take over. ""I wish them well. I hope it works. I actually put in the contract for the $20 that I will be happy to mentor and coach and do everything I can to help, for no charge, for a year — because I care about the town,"" he said. ""I'm sure we'll have problems along the way, but I expect this will work out well."" Munson and Whenhoff say they're not planning any major changes, at least in the short term. But Whemhoff says they are thinking about the future. ""We've got some great ideas for expanding it digitally, expanding maybe perhaps the involvement with young people there, student journalists, as far as teaching journalism,"" she said. They're planning to hold a community meeting when they arrive, to talk to the locals and answer questions. ""We just want the community to feel comfortable,"" Munson said.  They're due to arrive in Skagway in early March — just in time to cover a borough assembly meeting.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/skagway-news-owners-giveaway-1.5431784,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/skagway-news-owner-giveaway-1.5368236 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alaska-cabin-fire-helicopter-rescue-1.5377523,/news/canada/north/skagway-news-owner-giveaway-1.5368236 /news/canada/north/skagway-cruise-ship-yukon-tourism-1.5123025 /news/canada/north/skagway-news-new-owner-1.5022594
62,Catharine Tunney,2020-01-17T20:58:44.506Z,Canada offers $25K to families of Canadian victims on Flight PS752,"Canada will give the families of individuals killed in the downing of UIA Flight PS752 thousands of dollars to help with their immediate needs, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today — stressing it's only a first step toward getting Iran to compensate those grieving families. ""I want to be clear, we expect Iran to compensate these families,"" Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Friday morning. ""But I have met them. They can't wait weeks. They need support now."" Of the 176 passengers and crew killed, 57 were Canadian citizens and 29 were permanent residents, said the prime minister.  He said the government will give those families $25,000 per victim to help cover the cost of immediate needs such as funeral arrangements and travel. If all the victims' families seek financial help, the government could pay out about $2 million. For Masoud Pourjam, today's announcement was a small piece of good news in the midst of his struggles to resolve his brother's affairs. Mansour Pourjam, a dual Iranian-Canadian citizen, was one of the 176 people killed aboard Flight PS572. Masoud drives a taxi in Ottawa. He said it has been difficult for him to return to work, or to do simple things like going to the bank. ""I cannot work more than half-shift, even less, I have to go home. I try not to be alone by myself. It is embarrassing when a customer is in the car and I start crying,"" he said. ""For a few weeks, I can breathe a sigh of relief."" Trudeau said any compensation from Iran would go straight to families and would not be used to reimburse the federal government. Earlier this week, the government announced it also would waive fees and speed up visa processing times for those affected by the tragedy. About 20 families have asked for their loved ones' remains to be returned to Canada, with others have said they want their family members buried in Iran, said Trudeau. No bodies have been returned yet, added the prime minister, but he said the first remains will begin their trip home in the coming days. Trudeau's latest update comes as Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne is in Oman for a rare face-to-face meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif following last week's disaster near Tehran. Canada cut diplomatic ties with the country in 2012. ""Minister Zarif conveyed his profound regret for this terrible tragedy and Minister Champagne noted that he had met with families of victims this week who are deeply hurt and angry,"" says a readout of the meeting from Champagne's office. According to his office, Champagne pushed for concrete action after Canada — along with four other nations that lost citizens in the crash — gathered earlier this week to discuss Iran's role in shooting down the flight. After the meeting, Zarif tweeted that the two countries agreed ""on continued exchanges between respective experts."" ""Politicization of this tragedy must be rejected,"" he added.  In Oman today, met with Canadian FM <a href=""https://twitter.com/FP_Champagne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@FP_Champagne</a> to discuss consular, technical &amp; legal cooperation among nations impacted by <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS752?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PS752</a> tragedy. <br><br>Agreed on continued exchanges between respective experts.<br><br>Politicization of this tragedy must be rejected. Focus on victims’ families. <a href=""https://t.co/6QULuZhGcE"">pic.twitter.com/6QULuZhGcE</a> ""That is what we continue to push on. That is what the international community is pushing on,"" said Trudeau. ""So far, the people we've engaged with in Iran have been aligned with that wish, for now."" Ministers from five nations affected by the crash — Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom — listed their demands of Iran during a meeting in London on Thursday. They include a full investigation of the crash and an independent criminal probe. Their other demands are: Under international law, Iran is leading the latest aviation investigation because the crash occurred within its borders, but there are precedents for handing that responsibility over to another country that suffered losses. Trudeau said the flight's black box recorders were ""significantly"" damaged, adding there are only a few laboratories in the world, including one in France, that can process broken flight recorders quickly. In a rare sermon during Friday prayers, Iran's supreme leader called the destruction of the civilian airliner a bitter accident that saddened Iran and made its enemies happy. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran's international enemies have seized on the crash to question the country and its armed forces.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-oman-meeting-1.5430504,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/flight-ps752-mansour-pourjam-1.5431001 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-london-meeting-1.5428925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/carleton-university-mourns-plane-crash-victims-1.5428623 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649,/news/canada/ottawa/flight-ps752-mansour-pourjam-1.5431001 /news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-london-meeting-1.5428925 /news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649 /news/canada/ottawa/carleton-university-mourns-plane-crash-victims-1.5428623 /news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-universities-moment-silence-1.5427629 /news/technology/iran-fact-checking-site-factnameh-1.5426502

64,Muriel Draaisma,2020-01-21T03:36:44.936Z,Travellers at Pearson to be asked about coronavirus amid pneumonia outbreak in China,"Travellers to Toronto's Pearson International Airport will soon be asked a question about a new coronavirus that has caused a pneumonia outbreak in China. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters on Monday that travellers will be asked a screening question at electronic immigration kiosks if they have travelled to areas affected by the coronavirus in the last 14 days and they will be reminded to report flu-like symptoms to border services agents. There will also be messaging on arrival screens about the coronavirus, Tam said. ""The Chinese lunar year is coming so out of an abundance of precaution that's why we are putting out additional information for travellers,"" Tam said.  Federal public health officers will also post signs about the coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, at Vancouver International Airport and Montréal-Trudeau International Airport. According to the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency on Monday, 224 cases of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection have been reported in China. Of that number, 217 have been confirmed. China has reported four deaths. China has confirmed human-to-human transmission in the outbreak, which began at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China. Cases have since been reported in Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. Symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.  According to the World Health Organization, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death. The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. Canada has has no direct flights from Wuhan, and the number of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low. The overall risk of disease spread to Canada is considered low, the Public Health Agency of Canada has said in a statement on the weekend. An expert in Toronto, however, says the spread of the coronavirus needs to be closely watched. Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician, and founder and CEO of the digital health company BlueDot, said officials do not yet know fully how the coronavirus is spread and no vaccines are available. He said BlueDot, founded six years ago, is working on better ways to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Khan said airport screening is ""not the most efficient strategy."" Travellers are far more likely to get sick after they leave the airport, he said. The ""real front-lines"" are emergency departments, but education for travellers is still important, he added. ""We're in a world today where people can easily jump on a plane and go halfway around the world in a matter of hours,"" Khan said on Monday.  ""And we are also just at the precipice of the Lunar New Year, when we're anticipating there will be a mass migration of people and gatherings and congregations where this disease could potentially propagate,"" His organization is tracking the spread of the coronavirus to other countries and monitoring the outbreak of pneumonia in China. He said it is no longer about animal-to-human transmission, but instead human-to-human transmission. ""SARS had a mortality rate somewhere around 10 percent,"" he said. ""I think it still remains to be seen: Is this as deadly as SARS, or if this going to be is a milder illness?"" Khan said the coronavirus has the hallmarks of SARS, including the fact that it spread from markets to people, it has human-to-human transmission, it has infected health workers and there has possibly been what he called a ""super spreading event."" But officials don't yet know how severe it is, he added. ""SARS had an important impact here in Toronto,"" he said. ""That was no small event."" According to Tam, Canada has had no confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. Three people in Canada who travelled to Wuhan were investigated for the virus, but the results came back negative.  The World Health Organization (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus identified in China constitutes an international health emergency.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/coronavirus-pearson-airport-toronto-screening-measures-1.5434040,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477,/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 /news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 /news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477
65,Cody MacKay,2020-01-18T11:00:00.394Z,Picture of a Good Samaritan: P.E.I. photographer comes to aid of sick dog,"A P.E.I. photographer is pitching in to help cover the veterinary bill of a person she's never met, all because of her love for German shepherds. Amy Arsenault, from Richmond, P.E.I., heard through a friend that a dog in her community was ""not doing so well,"" and that the family was looking for help in paying rising vet costs.  ""I'm obsessed with German shepherds because I own two myself,"" she said. Arsenault read the Facebook post, which detailed the condition of a shepherd named Karma, owned by a family who also lives in Richmond. Arsenault saw the dog required extensive surgery at the Atlantic Veterinary College and she couldn't imagine if one of her pets was that ill. ""It just wasn't setting with me well. There has to be something I can do,"" she remembered thinking at the time she read the post. A photographer by trade, Arsenault figured she would put her talents to work to raise money for the family. She then created a campaign called Do You Believe in Karma? which asks Islanders to sign up for a paid photo shoot with their pet, with all proceeds going toward the vet bills. Karma's health failure was gradual, over the course of a few weeks, and severe. The four-year-old shepherd is owned by Jillian Cameron and she said her dog became unwell — throwing up, not eating and eventually wasn't having bowel movements.  During a visit to the Kensington Veterinary Clinic, veterinarians noticed a blockage in the dog's bowels, so the dog was taken to the AVC in Charlottetown. Veterinarians performed surgery, repositioning the dog's spleen and fixing organs that had ""telescoped."" ""The mass ended up basically blocking off her entire intestine, so they had to remove a lot of her intestine to repair it,"" Cameron said. ""There was actually other organs mixed up into her intestines because they telescoped on her."" Karma had some ""complications"" post-surgery where she wouldn't eat, Cameron said, but she recovered enough to go home on Thursday. Before bringing her home, the family faced a steep veterinary bill —  totalling around $13,000 altogether — which was paid for by a family member, Cameron said. The family didn't have pet insurance and having the dog euthanized was not what they wanted. ""She's the love of our life, for sure, she's our daughter. She's not a dog to us,"" Cameron said. Arsenault's goal to help cover the expense is to have 100 photoshoots, each at a cost of $100, so she can contribute $10,000 to help pay for the dog's life-saving surgery. ""I feel good at the end of the day knowing that I did try to do something instead of turning a blind eye,"" Arsenault said. ""I can probably sleep a little better knowing that I helped in some sort of way and, you know, it might inspire someone else."" Even though they live in the same small rural community, the two hadn't met before and haven't yet met in person. ""I just can't believe Amy would put something together like this,"" Cameron said, holding back tears. ""It's amazing. It really, really touches my heart. ""This girl has never met me, but yet she is staying up all night making flyers for me and Karma and our family. I have no words."" ""She just seems like such a really nice person that I'm enjoying to get to know,"" Arsenault said about Cameron. When it's all settled down, Arsenault said the two ""most definitely"" have to meet, and have their German shepherds play together.  ""They're a breed of their own, anyone who has one kind of knows what we're talking about,"" she said. By early Friday afternoon 16 Islanders had signed up for Arsenault's offer.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-photographer-taking-pictures-of-pets-to-raise-money-1.5427980,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-women-knit-blankets-humane-society-cats-dogs-1.5428062 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-crow-finds-home-1.5412709,[]

The fourth suspect, identified only as 20-year-old Dennis W., worked as a security guard at the museum, which is located in the heart of the German capital.

Houston, who succumbed to years of drug abuse in 2012, was an instant success after being signed to a record contract at age 19. Her 1985 debut had three No. 1 singles: Saving All My Love for You, How Will I Know and The Greatest Love of All. She had seven consecutive singles top the charts, a first for any artist. The daughter of gospel singer Cissy Houston and cousin of Dionne Warwick, she grew up in the business. The imposing, Brooklyn-born rap artist Christopher Wallace took on the identities of The Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls and was massively influential as rap became music's dominant style in the 1990s. With hits like Juicy and Big Poppa, he was the leader of an East Coast school of rap that found itself in a bitter rivalry with artists from the West Coast. He was killed in a still-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles at age 24 in 1997. On the album, Life After Death, with hits like Mo Money Mo Problems and Hypnotize, he became the first artist to earn multiple No. 1 singles after his death. Depeche Mode remains active, but its biggest influence came in the 1980s, when its post-punk, synthesizer-dominated music made the Brits a favorite of the goth subculture. Hits included Personal Jesus, Just Can't Get Enough and Enjoy the Silence. Depeche Mode shares with fellow inductees Nine Inch Nails the honor of having one of their signature songs covered by country legend Johnny Cash, who recorded Personal Jesus and NIN's Hurt during his late-career resurgence. With songs like Closer, NIN was a leader of the industrial rock movement in the 1990s. Like Green Day, a memorable performance in the mud at Woodstock '94 brought them a wider audience. Leader Trent Reznor has become a go-to soundtrack producer in addition to his continued work with Nine Inch Nails. The Doobie Brothers weren't critical favourites, but they had some indelible rock hits in the 1970s, including Listen to the Music, Black Water and China Grove. They're embarking on a 50th anniversary tour this summer, bringing members Michael McDonald, Pat Simmons, Tom Johnston and John McFee together for the first time in 25 years, and a rock hall induction makes for perfect publicity. The British band T-Rex was know primarily for its 1970s hit Bang a Gong (Get it On) and, to a lesser extent, Jeepster. The death of leader Marc Bolan in 1977 ended the band. The two non-performing inductees may be able to bring some star power with them. Music manager Irving Azoff has watched the finances for several bands, but is best-known as the manager of the Eagles since 1974. Jon Landau is a former music journalist, known for an indelible line when he saw a concert by a little-known artist in 1974: ""I saw rock 'n roll's future and its name is Bruce Springsteen."" Shortly thereafter, he became Springsteen's manager, a job he still holds today. Tickets for the induction ceremony go on sale Feb. 27. Performers will be announced at a later date.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/rock-hall-whitney-big-1.5427463,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/jackson-nicks-hall-fame-1.5078403,/news/entertainment/rock-hall-inductees-1.4944123
70,Laura Kane,2020-01-19T01:09:09.419Z,Disrespectful that Horgan won't meet during northern B.C. tour: hereditary chief,"It's disrespectful that Premier John Horgan won't meet with five hereditary chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline while he is touring northern British Columbia, says the highest-ranking chief. Chief Na'moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale, said the chiefs have asked the premier for a face-to-face discussion about the Coastal GasLink project. Na'moks said he was frustrated Horgan didn't meet with the chiefs on Friday, when the premier was in the area touring the LNG Canada project site in Kitimat and meeting with business leaders in Terrace.  ""It really bothered me that he was not that far away and yet somehow could not take the time to come and speak with us,"" Na'moks said Saturday. The premier's office said in a statement that upon receiving the meeting request on Thursday, it reached out to the hereditary chiefs to schedule a phone call. ""The aim of any discussion would be continued dialogue with a focus on de-escalation and on safety for all,"" it said.  The office added that the premier has commitments that rule out a meeting on this trip, but he is not ruling out a meeting completely.  ""Staff continue to be in touch to work on this,"" it said. Na'moks said only an in-person conversation will demonstrate respect for the chiefs, who assert jurisdiction over 22,000 square kilometres of unceded Wet'suwet'en territory. ""We want to show the respect back, too,"" he said. ""If you're going to have decent communication with anybody, it's best to be looking eye to eye.""  The chiefs have refused meetings with Coastal GasLink and instead called for discussions with provincial and federal government leaders, arguing the duty to consult is held by the Crown, not the project proponent. Coastal GasLink has signed benefits agreements with all 20 elected band councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline route. But the hereditary chiefs argue band councils only have jurisdiction over reserve lands rather than unceded territories. Crystal Smith, elected chief of the Haisla Nation, has said her band council signed an agreement because the project is creating jobs for Indigenous people and lifting communities from poverty.  Horgan said this week that the provincially permitted project will be built, and the rule of law must prevail. The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against supporters of the hereditary chiefs who have set up camps close to a pipeline work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order. However the RCMP has said it's not enforcing the injunction to allow time for dialogue between the hereditary chiefs and Coastal GasLink. Horgan was set to continue his northern B.C. tour on Saturday with an announcement about a new hospital in Fort St. James and by attending the men's B.C. Winter Classic hockey game in the community. Meanwhile, Adam Olsen, interim leader of B.C.'s Green party, was set to visit the camps set up by pipeline opponents on Saturday.  Federal Green MP Paul Manly also said he was traveling to Wet'suwet'en territory to meet with the hereditary chiefs. ""I am going to listen and to observe the situation on the ground,"" he said in a statement.  ""I have publicly stated my support for the hereditary chiefs and others who are engaged in non-violent action to protect Wet'suwet'en land. They are in a very challenging and volatile situation. They need to be heard.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/john-horgan-wet-suwet-en-territory-visit-1.5432347,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-pipeline-horgan-british-columbia-1.5425745 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wet-suwet-en-elder-calls-for-dialogue-as-pipeline-polarizes-some-in-northern-british-columbia-1.5432262,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/sechelt-residents-angered-by-logging-activity-on-neighbouring-property-1.5430029 /news/canada/british-columbia/contentious-jumbo-valley-to-become-indigenous-protected-area-with-21m-fund-1.5431665 /news/canada/british-columbia/summer-winter-m-s-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-tires-when-it-snows-1.5432005

72,John Peters,2020-01-12T12:00:00.257Z,Mental health advocate wants you to know how to survive suicidal sadness,"Please believe me, I know how it feels to want it all to stop. It wasn't that I even wanted to die. I didn't. I was just so exhausted from feeling the way I was feeling.  And while those moments — when dying feels like your only option — are scary, you feel so frustrated that it makes it so tempting.  But here's what I need you to know! When you hear someone has died by suicide, it's heart-wrenching, it makes you feel sick to your stomach, it brings on a sudden intense feeling of ache in your soul — and always leaves you asking ""Why?""  Too many of us know the sting that suicide brings. Too many of us are scared to talk about suicide, and too many of us perpetuate stigma around suicide.  I don't have every answer. Nor can I speak to every case.  But three things, in my experience, I know are certain. John Peters offers a personal message to anyone in crisis: I've often seen individuals who have been hesitant to talk about suicide, because they believe talking about it causes it to happen more frequently.  But I believe that if you're in pain, then you must talk about it. We need to have more conversations about suicide and life promotion with our families, children and friends, in our workspaces and communities. Through storytelling and education, we can abolish the stigma around suicide and be more compassionate. There is power, growth and a healing impact when we speak the truth.  Ignorance causes us to belittle, gaslight and silence those who are battling this enormous fight.  There is a persistent behaviour of calling people ""too sensitive"" — which is a way to avoid being held accountable and to continue with abusive behaviour.  It can be seen everywhere, when you hear ""it's just a joke"" or ""don't take it so seriously.""  We must remember — we don't know what an individual is experiencing and what a person's thresholds are. Humour that involves someone's identity, religion, sexual orientation, mental health or appearance could be detrimental.  We as a community need to acknowledge the truth: there are many of us who fight silent battles and we urgently need to cultivate safe, shame-free spaces and communities, where an individual feels safe enough to reach out when in crisis.  We as community members are all accountable to our neighbours. Every human being's life is precious.  Today, there is no excuse for saying ""I don't know."" With the amount of information on the internet, public health, and local mental health and suicide prevention initiatives, we can take steps every day to ensure that we are informed and equipped with the right information and tools.  Which brings us to … It is a privilege to have access to resources and efficient care.  Sadly, here in Canada, prejudice and neglect are two major barriers in the system.  Due to the genocidal foundation of our country, colonial systems and policies, a large number of Canadians do not have access to care.  I speak to this as a front-line worker. In my area, for example, we have fewer than 1,500 people, and the number of people who have to tirelessly fight to access care is appalling.  Now, think about that in a lens looking at the entire country.  If any Canadian suffers, if any Canadian dies by suicide, we fail, Canada fails — and continues to fail. Commission your community's leadership and local governments to bring in resources, and do not be gentle or quiet about it. BE LOUD AND ADAMANT! Community is incredible and when we are connected, we can move the earth. Conduct workshops facilitated by health professionals about suicide prevention, so the community can gain knowledge. Provide mental health therapists and programs to respond to our community members who reach out when they are in crisis. This will help us support and care for them in a good way.  Provide spaces where people can pray together, and provide creative outlets for people to nourish their gifts and talents. Each individual has a unique expression form and when it's nourished, it is powerful and healing.  You can also start prevention and life promotion initiatives in your own community to raise awareness. Really, the list could go on and on, because everyone is responsible for actively contributing to the prevention of suicide. There are lives at stake!  Many people, such as your friends, family, even you, may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.  I need you to know, if that's you right now, wherever you are — listen to me: You are loved, you are not a bad person, you are not a bad parent, you are not a bad kid, you are not a screw-up, and you are not worthless. You are beautiful, you are talented, you are gifted, you have purpose, and we need you to stay with us.  If you are struggling today, please reach out to a loved one.  You can also call the Canada Suicide Prevention Service at 1-833-456-4566, Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868, First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness Help Line at 1-855-242-3310 or you can visit thelifelinecanada.ca for more information on other crisis help lines.  Also, for young readers, please check out WeMatter campaign on Facebook, Instagram and wemattercampaign.org.  Remember: The world is beautiful with you in it!

73,Liz James,2019-12-23T12:00:00.423Z,Giving up store-bought gifts reconnected my family to the true spirit of Christmas,"Ten years ago, I threw up my hands in despair at the whole Christmas ""thing."" I'd spent a particularly stressful season buying, wrapping and bookkeeping. I realized that I'd lost touch with the holiday I loved so much.  There was a time when I eagerly bounded out of bed on Nov. 1 to see if the stores had put up decorations yet. I belted out Christmas music all season. Now the sight of a twinkling tree just made me feel tired.  I realized my kids were still of that tender age where I hadn't yet defined how Christmas ""should"" be. I had a unique opportunity. I explained, a la Whoville, that Christmas doesn't come from a store. I quickly learned that ""handmade Christmas"" could be even more exhausting than ""bought Christmas."" After the first year I learned to streamline. Each person picked a type of gift  and made a ton of them. You get what you get.  I learned to have a strong idea of the season I loved and wanted — beautiful decorations, nice smells in the kitchen, tons of time with my family — and to keep adjusting until I got there. My kids bought into the idea with remarkable enthusiasm. The toddler declared excitedly ""I get to BE Santa"" (in our household, we treat Santa as a metaphor more than a literal truth). Both boys spent all of November and December rescuing egg cartons from the trash, colouring them with markers and wrapping them to go under the tree. On Dec. 24, we went around to friends and neighbours who were delighted to receive partially wrapped bits of trash from exuberant three- and five-year-olds wearing Santa hats. It was all the cuteness of regular Christmas, with far less guilt for getting rid of everything the minute the season has passed. A couple of years in, I found a five-year-old sitting beside the tree surrounded by piles of gifts. He declared, ""Mom, I have more presents than ANYBODY,""  Looking at the piles he'd sorted, I saw that he meant he'd made more presents than anybody.  I was sold. I figured it would end when they went to school, but it didn't. They'd return each January to join in the chorus of ""what'd you get?"" with their heartfelt speeches about creating the Christmas that matters to you. I thought this would get them ostracized for sure, but it gave them a kind of celebrity. The boys' sense of fairness was helped by the fact that we do presents at other times of the year. I'd see something perfect for them in a store in May and bring it home as a spontaneous gift, especially when travel was imminent. I once overheard one of the boys saying ""we don't do bought Christmas, we do airplane Presents."" Last year, it changed. My 13-year-old asked if we could have a bought Christmas, so that he could find out what ""normal Christmas"" was like. His dad and I had a decision to make. Was handmade Christmas really about no-buying, or was it about intentionality?   We agreed to give bought Christmas a try. By mid-morning on Dec. 25, it appeared we'd never go back. The 13-year-old stood in piles of crumpled paper and declared, ""What have I been missing?"" To my surprise, this year he asked if we could go ""50-50"" between the two.  He told me that bought Christmas was ""fun, but obviously not for every year,"" and that it ""lacked a personal touch.""  His older brother would have skipped bought Christmas completely, because he thought it was ""exhausting"" and that ""making a gift means you're giving someone a part of you."" I have no idea what Christmas will look like for my boys when they're adults.  Or even next year. What I hope is that it will be a conscious choice. I also hope that if — or when — they feel like they've lost the season they love, they'll have the tools they need to find it again.

74,Erica Johnson,2019-06-10T20:42:18.198Z,Sunday school teacher says she was strip-searched at Vancouver airport after angry guard failed to find drugs,"A former Sunday school teacher who was falsely accused of being a drug smuggler, detained at Vancouver International Airport and eventually strip searched says she is still traumatized by the treatment and is calling for greater oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency. Jill Knapp's run-in with CBSA agents took place on Jan. 9, 2016, on her way home to Calgary, after visiting her husband in Mexico City. The 39-year-old says she is only now speaking out about her experience because she was diagnosed with anxiety after her airport ordeal. ""It was traumatizing,"" Knapp told Go Public, explaining that no one told her why she was red-flagged as she attempted to make her connecting flight in Vancouver. She said she has no criminal record and had nothing in her luggage that would prompt a closer look. ""Within two minutes he called me a drug smuggler, mentioned a strip search, and even said that he was going to send me to the hospital for an X-ray [to look for drugs],"" says Knapp. ""And that was before he even asked me any questions."" A request under the Access to Information Act by the CBC reveals other airline travellers have officially complained about mistreatment by border agents including screaming, using foul language, belittling them, using racial profiling and physical force. A civil liberties advocate says the complaints point to the need for independent oversight of the CBSA, the only major law enforcement agency in Canada that doesn't have external review of employee conduct. ""When border agents operate — either at land crossings, at airports — there is very little oversight,"" says Tim McSorley, national co-ordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, based in Ottawa. Knapp says she had collected her luggage when she was pulled aside and directed to ""secondary inspection,"" where she says a border guard became instantly aggressive. ""Out of nowhere, he actually raised his voice at me and said, 'I think you're a drug smuggler,'"" says Knapp. ""He said, 'I deal with people like you every day.'"" Knapp says she told him she had been visiting her husband in Mexico and that she had applied for him to live in Canada, but says the agent didn't believe her. She says the agent also didn't believe her when he asked what her job was and Knapp told him she worked with law firms as a software instructor. ""He actually scoffed at me and said, 'You don't do that type of work.' How would he know what kind of work I did? He was getting angrier and angrier."" The agent confiscated her phone and demanded her password. Finding nothing incriminating on her phone or in her luggage, the agent called in a drug-sniffing dog, which also didn't detect anything. Knapp says she was eventually placed in detention, but says she wasn't told why. She requested to speak with a lawyer and was told staff placed a call on her behalf, but she never heard from anyone. She hadn't eaten for 14 hours, but was only offered half a glass of water and no food. She says CBSA staff denied her requests to use the bathroom. Knapp was growing increasingly concerned about her parents, who were picking her up in Calgary. Her father is a heart attack survivor, and she worried about causing him stress. In desperation, she says, she offered to have the strip search the agent had mentioned hours earlier. ""At that point, I was so scared of what they would do if I stayed, it was like … if this is what it takes for me to leave, I'm going to do it.'"" Knapp says two female officers entered the room and told her to strip from the waist up. She told them she was a Sunday School teacher before complying. Finding nothing, they ordered her to remove her clothing from the waist down. ""They actually made me turn around, open up my butt cheeks and squat,"" says Knapp. ""I was just in shock. I didn't quite understand what it involved."" Knapp was finally released, and her phone returned. She found half a dozen texts from her anxious husband wondering where she was. CBC requested an interview with the CBSA, but the agency declined. In a statement, it said it couldn't discuss Knapp's case due to privacy concerns. After Knapp filed a complaint, she obtained internal documents through the Privacy Act, in which CBSA spokesperson Isabel McCusker wrote: ""The review of Ms. Knapp's clearance established that the [border services officers] involved in her examination followed standard procedures and guidelines."" CBC received over 1,700 pages of documents, most of the material heavily censored, after submitting a request under the Access to Information Act to find out how many other travellers have filed complaints about their treatment at the hands of the CBSA. We asked for complaints the agency classified under ""Officer/employee conduct,"" ""Questioning"" and other categories, for Vancouver International Airport, Toronto's Pearson International Airport and Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2018. The documents contain more than 800 allegations investigated by the CBSA about border agents and inappropriate behaviour, including the following: ""Officer commented, 'People like you who can't afford to travel always traffic drugs.'"" ""Threw me on the ground, yelling 'Don't resist'... [other] agents loved this and were laughing."" ""Hauled into the airport jail and treated like trash."" ""He called me moron more than once ... mocked my ... accent."" ""I was roughly frisked ... detained/held for questioning for seven hours."" ""He attacked me in the baggage claim area ... made anti-Semitic remarks."" ""He was pushing me with his hands ... started using foul language."" ""They broke my iPad."" ""Pulled out a knife in a threatening manner ... stared at me and then thrust the knife into the cardboard box."" The CBSA has a code of conduct, which says officers will act with ""professionalism, integrity and respect."" ""It's completely unacceptable and … kind of repulsive that people go through this when they're simply trying to travel to their destination,"" says McSorley, who reviewed the complaints. ""It's ... just common courtesy and decency that you wouldn't swear, use racist terms, use anti-Semitic terms, use physical force against someone who hasn't broken a law."" A CBSA spokesperson said during the calendar years 2016 to 2018, it investigated 821 allegations of misconduct by agents at all border crossings, of which 615 led to disciplinary action — including termination. McSorley's organization has been pushing for years for external oversight of the CBSA. ""There are millions of people crossing our border, flying into the country,"" says McSorley. ""The public deserves transparency from [the CBSA]."" For three years, the federal government has been promising to bring in oversight, and a bill is currently before the House of Commons. However, it has not yet received royal assent, and time is running out before the House breaks for the Oct. 21 federal election. Harassment, sexual assault among alleged misconduct by border agents investigated by CBSA In another internal CBSA memo Knapp obtained through the Privacy Act, as part of an internal investigation into the complaint she filed, an officer wrote that she was detained because her eyes appeared to be bloodshot — perhaps raising suspicion of drug use. Knapp says her eyes were red due to crying because she missed her husband. The officer also noted she was wearing bulky clothing, which Knapp disputes, saying she was wearing a fitted yoga outfit. Lastly, the officer questioned why she was flying through Vancouver on her way home to Calgary from Mexico. ""That was because I was using Aeroplan and that was the only route I could do,"" says Knapp. ""But the thing is, no one ever raised any of these concerns with me."" Knapp says she is speaking out about what happened to her to try to encourage Ottawa to change how complaints about the CBSA are investigated. ""I'm a safe person to talk about it because I'm a Canadian citizen … and I have no risk of deportation or anything like that,"" she says.

75,Anonymous,2020-01-19T15:15:47.984Z,Oprah Winfrey details her decision to withdraw from Russell Simmons doc ,"Oprah Winfrey said Friday that Russell Simmons attempted to pressure her about her involvement with a documentary in which several women detail sexual abuse allegations against the rap mogul, but his efforts were not what prompted her to leave the project. ""He did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me,"" Winfrey told The Associated Press through a spokesperson on Friday. It was not anything Simmons said that prompted Winfrey to withdraw from the On the Record film, according to Winfrey, but rather inconsistencies in the story of one of Simmons' accusers, Drew Dixon, that she felt needed to be addressed. Winfrey said Friday that she still believes Dixon and other women in the film, but that more reporting was needed. On the Record directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have said they have ample evidence against Simmons, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings. Winfrey has said she wanted to delay the release of the film, scheduled to premiere Jan. 25 at the Sundance Film Festival, but that that view was not shared by the film's directors. On the Record had been part of her partnership with Apple, which no longer will distribute the documentary. Winfrey, who herself has spoken openly of being sexually abused, announced she was leaving as executive producer on Jan. 10, saying that more work was needed and that the filmmakers were ""not aligned"" in their ""creative vision."" The film's producers, Impact Partners, said in a statement earlier this week that the movie was ready for Sundance. ""We have always championed the voices of those who have been wrongly silenced. The women in this film have made a great sacrifice by coming forward to tell their stories in their own words. We are honoured to support them,"" the Impact statement reads. ""We stand firmly behind the work of the intrepid filmmakers who continue to break new ground by advancing important stories in the public interest."" The AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Dixon has told her story publicly, including on CBS This Morning earlier this week. The communications between Winfrey and Simmons and her concerns about Dixon's story were first reported by The New York Times. Simmons has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, a Simmons representative issued a statement, saying ""If defending himself against terrible accusations is considered intimidation, then there would be no justice."" Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, Winfrey disputed allegations by the makers of On the Record that she gave them little warning before her Jan. 10 announcement. In a story which ran early Friday, Dick and Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter that they received just 20 minutes notice before Winfrey issued her statement. ""It was very disappointing and upsetting,"" Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them. That was our first thought. 'Oh my God. Let's tell everybody and figure this out.'""  Winfrey told the AP that Dick and Ziering knew well of her intentions. She said she had raised concerns last month about the film needing more work. According to Winfrey, she told Dick and Ziering that ""new information"" had made her see gaps she ""thought needed to be filled"" and that it was better to ""take a rest."" ""They said they would go on with or without me,"" Winfrey told the AP.

Youngs was a reporter, producer, executive producer and senior manager for CBC News in Winnipeg, Calgary and Toronto and covered politics at newspapers in Ontario and Manitoba. A Hamiltonian by birth, he was the senior project manager for the development of CBC Hamilton.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. If there is a checklist for how to bungle a sensitive and fractious political announcement, Caroline Mulroney's appearance - or non-appearance - in Hamilton this week would tick most of the boxes. Indeed, it might just tick all of them. In just a few hours the minister of transportation for Ontario kiboshed a long-planned light rapid transit project for Hamilton, and blamed ballooning costs on the previous government, but didn't give any details around how or why they rose. On top of that she ducked out of a planned media briefing, and left town, for some reason, with a police escort.  Predictably, this amateur hour approach to political announcements has reignited the long-running debate over the LRT in Hamilton. Opponents are delighted; its proponents dismayed. City councillors — who were and still are pretty much in the dark — are left trying to figure out what to do with the $1 billion Mulroney left on the table for unspecified transit projects in Hamilton. They will have to hurry. Mulroney wants a plan by February — which doesn't leave a lot of time to figure out how to spend a lot of money. All this has served to underline that even though they have been in power for 18 months, the Ford government is still making things up as it goes along. And when it runs into turbulence as it did this week in Hamilton, its favourite response is to pivot quickly to blaming the former Liberal government for its troubles. It was Premier Doug Ford who came up with a plan for a new subway line for Toronto, along with $11.2 billion in funding to build it. It, too, came out of the blue to the city and its citizens, and upended planning and work that had already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  For her part, Mulroney undid $165 million in work and preparation for the Hamilton line. About half of that sum was used to purchase property along the proposed LRT line — property the province now owns. All of which must make city officials in Mississauga, Ottawa and other Ontario municipalities, where transit projects are or will be in the works, just a tad nervous. Who knows what comes next if the province decides to draw up its own transit plan for one city, and unilaterally decides to kill a project in another?  That explains why Mulroney decided that the real culprit here is the previous Liberal regime.  The Wynne government, Mulroney said in a statement, had not been ""upfront"" about the cost for building and running the LRT. It was really $5.5 billion, according to her. Although Mulroney has yet to reveal the figures and details to show how the PC government came to that conclusion.  ""We cannot afford to continue the Liberals' approach of making empty promises today and accumulating a massive legacy of debt for our children and grandchildren,"" she said. Slagging the Liberals for ""empty promises"" on the LRT is a bit tricky, given that Ford declared a little over a year ago that if Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger ""wants an LRT, he'll get an LRT."" That was then, it seems, and this is now. Voters decided more than 560 days ago that they had had enough of Wynne and her party. The Liberal party is now just a beleaguered rump, huddled in a corner at Queen's Park trying to figure out how to claw its way out of a hole. The Liberals may have started this project, but the responsibility for it now lies with the PCs. Voters in Hamilton and across Ontario deserve a better explanation of how and why the cost skyrocketed, how the province plans to deal with all the property it owns in Hamilton, and what comes next for transit in Hamilton, and in other cities.  What they don't need is yet another helping of partisanship, finger-pointing and blaming someone else.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/amateur-hour-lrt-announcement-shows-tories-can-t-get-past-blaming-liberals-1.5403214,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-lrt-cancelled-1.5397519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-costs-1.5401095 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/liuna-lrt-1.5402413,/news/canada/hamilton/liuna-lrt-1.5402413 /news/canada/hamilton/lrt-costs-1.5401095 /news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-lrt-cancelled-1.5397519

Kootenays after they were found unresponsive on Friday, according to RCMP. A statement from Mounties in Nelson, B.C., said the snowboarder was found unresponsive in a tree well at the Whitewater Ski Resort in the Selkirk Mountains just before 12:30 p.m. PT on Friday. RCMP said a passerby found the man in an out-of-bounds area, phoned first responders and began CPR. Paramedics later pronounced the man dead. The skier was found in the snow among the trees on the Fernie Ski Hill, more than 300 kilometres away, just after 4:30 p.m. In a second statement, RCMP said the man had been separated from his skiing partner, who re-traced his run to find the man unresponsive. The ski patrol arrived and took the man off the mountain. Paramedics transported him to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A statement from Mounties said the skiier was a Fernie man, originally from Quebec. The snowboarder was a Central Kootenay man. Both were in their 30s. RCMP and the BC Coroners Service are investigating both deaths. Whitewater Ski Resort, where the snowboarder was found, posted a bulletin about the dangers of tree wells less than a week before the man's death.

When eHealth officials attempted to open files on affected servers they received a message that the files had been encrypted and would remain inaccessible until a payment was made. The Saskatchewan Cancer Agency oversees the two cancer clinics in Saskatoon and Regina. It disconnected from the eHealth network after learning of the assault on the system.

79,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-04-11T00:00:00.447Z,Bank regulator's report on aggressive sales tactics weakened after government — and banks — reviewed drafts,"Last year's report from Canada's banking regulator about aggressive sales tactics underwent several drafts that eliminated proposed protections for consumers — edits that were made after the regulator sent early versions to the federal Finance Department and the big banks. Internal documents from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) — obtained under Access to Information and provided to Go Public — show that some recommendations for action were weakened or removed, including a proposal to require that banks work in the best interest of consumers.  Another key edit was the addition of a line saying the review did not find ""widespread mis-selling"" by the banks. It all paints a picture of the ""cosy"" relationship between the country's six big banks, the agency that's supposed to regulate them and the federal government, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""[The banks] have disproportionate access and perhaps disproportionate influence."" The report was prompted in part by months of reporting by Go Public, in which hundreds of current and former bank employees said they were pushed to upsell customers to try to meet sales targets. Some described feeling pressured to do such things as mislead customers about credit card fees and mortgage rates, forge signatures on credit card and loan insurance products and secretly increase lines of credit. At the time, the banks told Go Public that they act in the best interests of their clients, and that employees are expected to follow various codes of conduct. The documents were obtained through Access to Information by public policy researcher Ken Rubin, who asked for draft copies of FCAC's report on sales practices at the big banks, and related correspondence. The regulator's review focused on BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, TD and National Bank. It found that banks encourage employees to sell products and services and reward them for sales success. But FCAC also said it did not find evidence of widespread harm to consumers. Although FCAC staff interviewed 600 bank employees, and reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents and 4,500 customer complaints, the report did not name a single bank or quote from any of the interviews. ""When I saw the March [2018] report, I said, 'There's more to it than meets the eye,'"" said Rubin, one of Canada's most prolific practitioners of federal Access to Information requests. Thomas found it particularly interesting that the regulator sent a draft of its report to the very banks at the centre of its eight-month review. ""[The banks] have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking,"" he said. ""It's a fact of life."" Sending the banks a draft copy is a big concern for consumer advocate Duff Conacher. ""You don't share … the evidence you gathered,"" said the co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa. ""That evidence is the basis of your conclusions as to whether the law has been violated."" The banking regulator told Go Public it sent the banks a draft report so the financial institutions could ""identify factual errors."" ""If the agency wanted to check the facts in the report … they could have just sent them those facts,"" Conacher said.  In a subsequent draft, a line was added pointing out that banks are ""in the process of enhancing their oversight and management of sales practices risk."" It's not known who proposed adding that line. Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) whether it requested a draft copy of the report.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labreche sent an email that did not respond to that question, writing, ""The Canadian Bankers Association and its member banks regularly communicate and meet with supervisory bodies, including the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, as part of the normal course of the oversight process."" The internal documents also include dozens of pages from the big banks, which appear to be responses to the regulator's draft report.  Go Public is not able to know their contents — including the date they were written, or who wrote them — because entire pages were redacted under an Access to Information exemption that protects commercial interests. The documents also reveal that the banking regulator supplied a draft to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his department three months before publicly releasing it last year. Conacher says the regulator, purportedly an independent agency, should not have given the minister and his department a chance to vet and comment on its report. ""It's inappropriate and improper for a minister to be looking at the draft conclusions of a law enforcement agency,"" he told Go Public. ""That means decisions could be made on the basis of politics, not on the basis of the facts and the law."" One of the most significant edits to the initial draft that was sent to the finance minister was the addition of a finding on Page 1 that says, ""FCAC did not find widespread mis-selling during its review."" ""It's hard to say … exactly what happened,"" said John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a consumer organization based in Ottawa. ""The language seems to belie the rest of the report, which goes into some detail about how sales practices — which are a little unseemly — can be performed."" Go Public requested an interview with Morneau, but his spokesperson, Pierre-Olivier Herbert, said the minister was unavailable. In a statement, Herbert did not respond to Conacher's criticism that it ought to be considered inappropriate for the minister to receive a draft report from the banking regulator. A Finance Department spokesperson said it is routine for financial sector agencies to share documents for comment and to confirm facts. Go Public received various versions of the banking regulator's report, including several versions of the original draft, a revised copy after it went to the finance minister, and the final report.  Sentences, recommendations or conclusions are redacted in several drafts, based on an exemption in Canada's Access to Information Act that allows the head of a government institution to refuse to disclose any advice involving the institution or a federal cabinet minister. The exemption applies to advice or recommendations that occur at a ministerial level, essentially to allow confidentiality in the policy-making process. Go Public asked the minister about additions made after he had received a copy. In an email, Morneau's spokesperson wrote, ""the Minister's office did not provide comments or request any edits to the FCAC's report. The findings in the FCAC's report are entirely their own."" However, the documents indicate that Morneau's department made at least six comments on the first draft of the report, including about changing parts that say the regulator will introduce certain reforms to the regulator ""proposes"" them. Most of the comments from the department are redacted. ""The biggest thing is there were three recommendations saying banks should be 'required' to make changes,"" Conacher said. ""And those were all changed to 'suggestions' that the banks should do some things. ""Suggestions are meaningless, if you're actually trying to solve a problem. The banks don't have to do anything."" The draft sent to the minister's office included a line saying, ""Require banks to work in the best interests of their customers."" The line didn't make the final version of the report. Some other language that was critical of the banks — such as a line saying that banks ""lean disproportionately in favour of a sales driven culture"" — was also dropped before the report was published. Go Public checked the lobbyist registry to see how many times the banks or their umbrella group, the CBA, lobbied government officials, senators, MPs — including Morneau — the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and FCAC during the 12-month period between when the regulator announced it was conducting a bank review and the date it released its report. Between March 15, 2017, and March 20, 2018, the big banks and the CBA lobbied a total of 165 times. In the month leading up to the release of FCAC's report, the CBA met with the regulator's deputy commissioner, Brigitte Goulard, four times — including the day before the report was published. Lobbying is legal, but those who do significant amounts of it are required to file a record with the lobbying commissioner, who then makes the information public online. ""The banks — because they're an important economic asset to the country — have to be listened to,"" said the University of Manitoba's Paul Thomas. ""They have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking. It's a fact of life."" As a comparison, Go Public asked four consumer advocacy organizations how many times they had the ear of lawmakers and banking watchdogs during the same period. In total, they had fewer than 10 meetings with policy-makers and FCAC to discuss the sales practices of banks, they said. ""It's extremely concerning to us, of course, that consumer groups are not more meaningfully supported to participate in these important conversations,"" wrote Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. ""The council continues to have serious concerns about the resources available to facilitate meaningful consumer representation at not only FCAC but across government concerning consumer protection."" Thomas says after combing through the various versions of the bank regulator's report, the relationship between the banks, the government and the banking regulator can be difficult to figure out. ""The whole process is submerged. It's not transparent,"" he said.  ""If it hadn't been for Access to Information requests, we wouldn't know the extent to which the banks were given a certain privileged status in this process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fcac-bank-report-on-sales-tactics-weakened-1.5091115,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/td-tellers-desperate-to-meet-increasing-sales-goals-1.4006743 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/banks-consumers-sales-violations-1.4681705 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-financial-advisor-reacts-to-fcac-report-bank-sales-culture-1.4625096,/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575 /news/canada/british-columbia/td-tellers-desperate-to-meet-increasing-sales-goals-1.4006743 /news/politics/banks-consumers-sales-violations-1.4681705 /news/business/cibc-financial-advisor-reacts-to-fcac-report-bank-sales-culture-1.4625096

82,Jennifer Sweet,2020-01-18T14:49:21.076Z,The anatomy of a protest: Moncton sociologist digs into Rexton shale gas protests,"It's not often New Brunswickers unite around an issue across linguistic and cultural lines. A sociologist from the University of Ottawa says that's why she was so intrigued by anti-shale gas demonstrations in the province between 2010 and 2016. At the time, exploration was taking place and being planned in a few parts of the province. At the height of protests in Kent County, dozens of people were arrested and RCMP vehicles were set on fire after police moved to enforce an injunction against a blockade by people protesting against shale gas exploration work. Marie-Hélène Eddie, who is originally from Moncton, was studying in Ottawa in October 2013. She followed events in the news when Indigenous protesters and RCMP clashed violently in Rexton. She decided to study the protest movement for her doctoral thesis at the University of Ottawa, which was published last month. The thesis focuses on three groups — Mi'kmaq, Acadians and anglophones — and how they mobilized against development of the shale gas industry. Eddie had the impression the protest movement was being led by First Nations people in Kent County. One of the first discoveries she made in her research was that this was not the case. ""It was happening all over the province, not just in Kent County. It was happening in Fredericton mainly and in other regions as well."" In Kent County, however, Eddie discovered that the first group to organize was Acadian — Notre Environnement, Notre Choix — based in Saint-Louis. In English, the group is called, Our Environment, Our Choice. They were followed closely, said Eddie, by an anglophone group called Upriver Environmental Watch, near Rexton. Indigenous people actually joined the fight ""months, if not years later,"" she said. Eddie speculated this staggered entry may have been related to media coverage. ""Different groups can have different access to the media,"" she said. French-language journalists in the province tend to be ""very eager"" to support the Acadian community, while Indigenous people ""essentially have no media supporting them."" She documented some differences in coverage among news outlets. Eddie analyzed 296 articles from various news outlets. She found articles in Irving-owned publications gave precedence to voices in favour of shale gas development 53 per cent of the time. The rdate was 24 per cent for articles in non-Irving-owned publications. Brunswick News reports cited industry sources first 30 per cent of the time. The rate in articles by other publishers was eight per cent. ""Irving media had coverage that was more biased towards the industry and towards shale gas development,"" she said. ""It's important to research that, to see that, to discuss that and to ensure that in New Brunswick we have a variety of media with a variety of ownerships — which we don't presently have.""  Eddie was quick to add that some of the differences in coverage were ""subtle"" and she didn't think there was any ""malice"" involved. ""The journalists themselves I really think tried to do their job as well as they could,"" she said. ""That was very apparent in the interviews."" The journalistic resources on the ground in different parts of the province probably also had an impact, said Eddie. For example, the French media more frequently have a journalist that is assigned to Kent County than the English media  ""When you're covering, for example, the Rexton protest from Fredericton, it can become difficult to get people to give you interviews over the phone. ... It can be difficult to get the resources to travel to Kent County regularly. So it affects your capacity as a journalist to create relationships with the people on the ground and get the scoop and know what's going on."" Eddie was initially planning to focus on the way linguistic minorities mobilize or organize beyond linguistic issues. But she had to rethink her theoretical framework to account for the broader participation. ""I kept thinking, well, are anglophones really a minority? They clearly are not a minority the same way that First Nations are. They don't have the same barriers, the same issues."" As she dug deeper, it became obvious that many of the people involved in the movement actually had a lot in common. For one thing, supporters of the movement predominantly lived in rural areas, where exploration and potential shale gas development would take place. And in Kent County, where she focused her research, anglophone residents had very similar socio-economic status to Acadians and Indigenous people. They were relatively poor and had relatively low levels of formal education. ""It really seemed that all three groups actually were very disadvantaged compared to the rest of New Brunswick or the rest of Canada.""   She was blown away at how protest leaders were able to overcome these apparent barriers to get people involved. ""I still kind of get shivers thinking about it sometimes. ...They were very aware of their audience — being people who can sometimes be intimidated by the government, or people who may think that it's impossible that they'll succeed in the fight or people, in some cases, who didn't know how to read very well."" Community meetings and information sessions were held where different aspects of the issue were explained, like the meaning of a moratorium, for example, the amount of water needed for shale gas exploration and exploitation, the known risks and the findings of the latest studies.  ""Just informing people — not telling them what to think, but getting them the facts that they needed to decide by themself what they thought about shale gas."" At the provincial level, Eddie said, the protest movement built momentum and unity through the formation of an umbrella group— The New Brunswick Anti-Shale Gas Alliance — and the designation of single anglophone and francophone spokespersons — Jim Emberger and Denise Melanson. Support never approached unanimity, said Eddie, but the movement still proved effective. ""It was a dividing issue and it's hard to tell how much the groups had an impact on public opinion.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/anti-shale-gas-movement-protests-1.5430843,[],[]

On the outskirts of Tehran, the fragments of what was once a journey of many dreams lie scattered against a bleak landscape. Amidst the twisted metal and clothing littering the scorched earth, there is a single red shoe of a child. It has a pretty bow, slightly singed by the flames that engulfed Flight PS752 in its last moments before it crashed from the sky in a great ball of fire, bringing to a sudden end so many stories yet to be told, so many joys yet to be discovered. The little shoe made me think of one-year old Kurdia, whose parents Evin and Hiva had taken her halfway across the world, from Canada to Iran, to celebrate a wedding. Persian weddings, we jokingly say, need a football stadium to accommodate the guests. How many adoring grandparents and elders, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends must have smothered little Kurdia with affectionate kisses, seeing her for the first time, not knowing that it would also be the last. It seems to be the fate of people in the Middle East to suffer. Some weeks earlier, hundreds of Iranian youths were shot on the streets of Tehran for protesting corruption, crying for freedom, and their loved ones were arrested for mourning their loss. Mothers and fathers have been killed by barrel bombs in Idlib and Aleppo, standing in a bread line to appease the unbearable pain of hunger. And it is only a matter of time before we witness, yet again, those desperate to flee such horrors, drowning in the depths of the Mediterranean while trying to cross the forbidding sea in rubber dinghies, in search of a better world. And now, the grim sight of a long succession of body bags amidst the wreckage of the aircraft that carried so many on their way home to Canada, the country that opened its doors to them, answering their dream of a better future. One tries to be philosophical at times like this. ""Death is our wedding with eternity,"" the great mystic Rumi wrote. It is difficult to reconcile that wisdom with the horrors the hapless passengers must have experienced in their final moments. Yet, just as weddings are a communal experience that teach us what it means to belong, so too communal grief and mourning shows us, in the hour of darkness, the astonishing light of the human spirit; the inextricable ties that bind us together. In ""Tehranto"" and Montreal, Windsor and Guelph, Edmonton and Vancouver, Halifax and London, across this vast space we call Canada, people have lost family and friends, neighbours and colleagues, teachers and students. This isn't just another horrible thing happening ""out there,"" in that other world of suffering that momentarily intrudes on our lives of privilege, trivialized by a tweet or fleeting Facebook post, soon to be forgotten. Now it is happening to ""us,"" we who call ourselves Canadians, who imagine belonging as something that is beyond the bonds of blood and soil; a transcendent connection built on a shared humanity. The flag flies at half-mast at my university in Montreal, as it does across other campuses through the country. Many on that ill-fated flight were professors, researchers, and students, part of Iran's massive brain drain as accomplished and ambitious youth settle here in our midst to start new lives. On my mobile phone, there are numerous e-mails and text messages from fellow Canadians, expressing sympathy and concern, mourning the loss that has become ours for the simple reason that we have come to live in the same place – a wonderful and precious place where, amidst grief and suffering, compassion reigns supreme. Just as joyous celebrations define who we are, communal bereavement — healing together, whether it is with our Indigenous brothers and sisters who were here before us or with the recent immigrant returning home from a previous home — teaches us what it means to be human. What it means to be Canadian. It unites us at the core, gives us a deeper identity, emancipates us from the superficial divisions and distractions that we confuse with true meaning.

The Iranian authorities are also prepared for experts from France, Canada and the United States to examine the data from the boxes, the semi-official news agency said. All 176 people aboard the plane were killed when Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down on Jan. 8 shortly after takeoff from Tehran en route to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. ""With the use of the expertise of the countries of France, Canada and America we will try to read the [flight data recorder] in Kyiv,"" Hassan Rezaifar, a director in charge of accident investigations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, was quoted as saying by Tasnim. ""If this effort is unsuccessful then the black box will be sent to France."" The black boxes will not be read in Iran, Rezaifar said, according to Tasnim. Fifty-seven of the dead were Canadian. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been pressing for a full investigation into the plane downing, said on Friday that Iran should send the black boxes to France for analysis. France was one of the few countries with the ability to read the flight and cockpit data recorders from the jet, which were badly damaged, Trudeau told a news conference in Ottawa. Iran has faced a deepening crisis abroad and at home over the plane disaster, with authorities taking several days to announce that its military had accidentally shot the plane down. The downing occurred as Iran was on high alert for possible retaliatory action following its strikes on Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops. Those strikes were in revenge for the U.S. killing of top military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone attack in Baghdad on Jan. 3.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-ukraine-plane-crash-black-boxes-1.5432118,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/compensation-victims-ps752-1.5424415 https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/,https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/ /news/thenational/anger-in-iran-over-flight-752-1.5425866 /news/world/iran-jetliner-unintentionally-shot-down-1.5423608 /news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 /news/world/ukraine-investigators-knew-within-hours-missile-ps752-1.5423957 /news/world/iran-missile-ps752-1.5424082
86,Anonymous,2020-01-20T14:00:00.442Z,Inquest into Cynthia Blackjack's death begins in Carmacks,"A coroner's inquest begins Monday into the 2013 death of Carmacks, Yukon, resident Cynthia Blackjack. The first two days of the inquest are scheduled to happen in Carmacks at the local community centre. On Wednesday, it resumes at the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre in Whitehorse. If weather drops below -35 C, hearings in Carmacks may be rescheduled, according to a release. Ten days have been scheduled for the proceedings. Yukon Territorial Court Judge Peter Chisholm has been appointed coroner for the inquest. Six jurors have been selected from two pools of candidates: three from Whitehorse and three from Dawson City. Blackjack was 29 years old when she died during a medevac flight to Whitehorse in November 2013. Yukon's former chief coroner refused requests from Blackjack's family and the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation for an inquest. The First Nation argued the coroner's original investigation was inadequate, and did not address ""systemic racism"" as a potential factor in Blackjack's death.  The Yukon Supreme Court agreed, and ordered an inquest. The coroner appealed, but the earlier court decision was upheld. The Yukon Court of Appeal found that in the days before she died, Blackjack had been in frequent contact with the Carmacks Health Centre complaining of abdominal pain. The day before she died, Blackjack was told by the health centre in Carmacks to go to the Whitehorse hospital — a two-hour drive away — and that she would have to find her own way there. The next day, Blackjack's condition worsened, but there was a delay in getting an ambulance to bring her back to the Carmacks Health Centre and then another delay in getting her on a medevac flight to Whitehorse.  The cause of her death was later determined to be liver failure. The Yukon appeal court ruled that the problems with the ambulance service alone justified holding an inquest. ""This is particularly apparent given her [Blackjack's] possible vulnerability as a First Nation citizen and the nature of the care she received in the period preceding her death, regardless of whether a causal link was established between those circumstances and the medical cause of her death,"" the 2018 appeal court judgment says.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/blackjack-inquest-begins-carmacks-1.5431891,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-little-salmon-carmacks-first-nation-1.3996823,/news/canada/north/blackjack-death-inquest-court-coroner-1.4877253 /news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-little-salmon-carmacks-first-nation-1.3996823
87,Reneltta Arluk,2019-12-28T15:45:52.275Z,Shared Lines: Why one Inuvialuk woman decided to get facial tattoos,"My great-grandmother, Alice Simon, had facial tattoos.  In the pictures we have of her, there are visible markings all up her cheeks but what always struck me was the thick black line that connected her bottom lip to her chin. So when I began to imagine that thick black line on my face, from lip to chin, I had more questions than answers as to why I wanted it. I'm not fully Inuk. My mother is Denesuline and Cree from the Fort Chipewyan region. My father was Inuvialuit but he was also Dene with Gwich'in roots. The woman who gave me this tattoo is a well known tattooer, Maya Sialuk Jacobsen of Greenland. She is an Inuk that studies the historical markings of Inuit women across the circumpolar North.  She said, ""I don't study land, I study patterns."" Her tattoo methods are traditional stick and poke or skin stitching ink with needle and thread. When I first contacted her, I sent an image of my great-grandmother, and Maya knew exactly where Alice Simon was from.  My great-grandmother spoke very little English; she was a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker. I did not get to grow up with her unfortunately. She died when I was just a young one, but when I was born, she came down to Fort Smith, N.W.T., from Inuvik to meet me. I was five months old.  She took care of me one night while my parents went to the movies. It was winter. In what was then an Inuvialuit practice, my great-grandmother took me outside, bare, and put me in the snow. I am not sure how long I was out there for. I am sure I cried. But even now I know her doing that to me was an act of love.  Through this winter custom, I was given the gift of resilience — a teaching that remains with me still.  She lived during a time when survival was the only way. She was a respected elder, cherished for her knowledge of preserving berries in the winter using techniques that are no longer practised.  Today Inuvialuktun is spoken by only a handful of Inuvialuit — mostly my great-grandmother's relatives, and likely because of her.  Alice was a matriarch. She gave the younger generations their Inuit names when they were born. Mine is Akpik.  It is the cloudberry that grows in the barren land — not too sweet but makes the best jam. Often Inuit are named after relatives who have passed or people in the community that have lived good lives. It's a way to instil positive traits in the young ones.  So when I learned my Inuk name was Akpik, I was confused. Why a berry?  I have a wonderful great aunt, Lillian Elias. Alice was her grandmother. Lillian is the matriarch now, and also a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker.  In one of our visits I asked her why great-grandmother Alice named me after a berry and not a relative. Auntie Lillian thought for a moment and said, ""maybe because they were her favourite."" It was clear to me getting tattooed would be a journey of reconnection, not only to my great-grandmother, but to the community of Inuit women wearing their ancestors' lines in celebration of who we are. I asked myself, why get this now? Easy, because it is time.  So much of our cultural teachings have been lost or taken away by colonialism. We know this, but most importantly we still feel this. In recent years there has been a resurgence of facial tattoos among Inuit women across the circumpolar north.  I received my thick black line so recently that in reflection of writing this, I am still unsure of the teachings it will offer me. I am fine with it, though.  This was not done to resolve any doubts or insecurities.  It was done to keep asking myself the questions about who I am at a time when we are needing to know who we are. We need to reconnect to our ancestral truths and I am grateful that my great-grandmother had the courage to wear hers at a time where many had started being denied theirs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-face-tattoo-reneltta-arluk-1.5397755,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-tattoos-holly-nordlum-1.4915457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jordan-konek-grandmother-arviat-photo-1.5118410,/news/canada/north/inuit-women-traditional-tattoos-kugluktuk-1.3563446 /news/canada/north/oviloo-tunnillie-ebook-stone-carver-1.5116895 /radio/tapestry/ink-and-identity-1.4841363/inuk-filmmaker-explains-the-emotionally-fraught-decision-to-get-traditional-face-tattoos-1.4841397
88,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-19T20:15:55.738Z,Trudeau cabinet holding 3-day retreat to plot parliamentary strategy for minority government,"Liberal cabinet ministers began meetings in Winnipeg today to set parliamentary priorities and strategize for what's expected to be a challenging winter session for the minority government. The three-day retreat will focus on themes laid out in the fall throne speech: growing the economy and the middle class, tackling climate change, and building healthy and safe communities, including new gun control measures and continued efforts to promote reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. One of the urgent orders of business is the federal response to the massive blizzard in Newfoundland and Labrador, where a state of emergency was declared in St. John's and several other municipalities. On Saturday, government ministers pledged whatever assistance the province requires, including military personnel, and today ministers confirmed that 300 or more troops plus equipment would be deployed. Governing without a majority means the government must get at least one of the opposition parties on board to pass legislation and the upcoming budget. On Sunday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau acknowledged there will be ""some differences"" in how the government drafts its economic plan. ""Importantly, we will have to, as we get to Parliament, make sure that we are talking with all of the other parties. That's been a priority we've had over previous years — I'm sure it will be more robust this year,"" he said. As the nation continues to grieve the loss of 57 Canadians killed in the Flight PS752 airline disaster in Iran, mounting tensions in the Middle East and other global affairs will also be high on the agenda. But domestic pressures are paramount, and the chosen location of the retreat is both symbolic and politically strategic. ""It is a city in the West where they should have done better in the last election and they have the potential to do better in the next election — that we know will be probably sooner rather than later,"" said Liberal commentator Greg MacEachern. ""Going to Manitoba makes more sense than going to Alberta. There's still a lot of active issues in Alberta, which might have obscured any messages the government wants to get out."" The Liberals were shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Oct. 21 election, reflecting a strong dissatisfaction in the region over the federal carbon tax and slow progress on building a pipeline. While Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister may not be the Liberal government's biggest fan, MacEachern said, he has demonstrated a tendency to focus on areas of common interest rather than making partisan attacks as other premiers, such as Alberta's Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, have done. In an attempt to heal the regional divisions, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Chrystia Freeland, one of his top-performing ministers, to take on the intergovernmental affairs file in his Nov. 20 cabinet shuffle. To further demonstrate the government's commitment to addressing regional discontent, Trudeau also named Freeland deputy prime minister and tasked her with working with all ministers to restore relations with the West. After his Liberals were reduced to a minority government, Trudeau promised to adopt a more collaborative approach in working with both the provincial premiers and the federal opposition parties. The weeks and months ahead will test that resolve and the government's ability to navigate the new reality to pass legislation and a federal budget. ""This session for them will be where the rubber hits the road, where you have to look at things, very frankly, through a political lens,"" MacEachern said.  ""Who else is going to support this? You can have the best ideas in the world, but in a minority parliament, if it doesn't appeal to enough people in another party, they're going to go nowhere."" MacEachern said outside the work of the House of Commons, ministers must grapple with external issues: the raging bushfires in Australia, rising tensions with Iran and how to navigate Canada-U.S. relations in an election year, including ratifying a new trilateral trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico. Daniel Béland, a political science professor and director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, believes getting ""NAFTA 2.0"" — also called CUSMA (the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade) past the finish line must be a top economic priority for the government. He said there's a danger in delay, because U.S. President Donald Trump could respond negatively if he becomes impatient. ""That's the most important issue by far in terms of our international footprint because our economic relationship with the U.S is so fundamental to our development, to our economic well-being,"" he said.  Béland agrees that Trudeau and his ministers will need to adopt a more conciliatory approach to governing in order to pass that trade deal and other pieces of legislation, but said the Liberals likely have some breathing room before the next campaign. The Bloc Québécois and NDP don't have the desire or money to fight a snap election, and the Conservatives are in the throes of a leadership race to replace Andrew Scheer, he said. ""Right now I'm not sure who has the incentive to have an early election, who could pull the trigger,"" Béland said. Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen expects the Liberals will capitalize on the fact her party is dealing with a leadership race, but warned that the opposition will work to hold the government to account on key files, including the new NAFTA. She said agricultural and other sectors negatively impacted by the deal must be properly compensated. Bergen said selecting Winnipeg as the venue for the cabinet retreat is likely meant to send a signal that the Liberals are listening and willing to address the issues driving western alienation. But to date, she said Trudeau has shown arrogance and a superficial acknowledgement of the region's pressing concerns. ""That will be a very important test that these Liberals are facing. And do they have the capacity to pass it? I don't know,"" she said. ""I don't know if they understand the challenges that western Canadians are going through and if some of their political ideology in terms of anti-pipeline sentiment in their caucus and cabinet, anti-development sentiment in their caucus and cabinet, can overshadow the need for them to put the interests of all Canadians first."" NDP house leader Peter Julian said as the government prepares for its upcoming budget, New Democrats will be pressing for issues that will help Canadians, such as pharmacare and a $15 federal minimum wage and dental care for those who need it most. ""If all the Liberals want is to stay in power, they can keep counting on the Conservatives or the Bloc for support"" Julian said in a statement to CBC.  ""But, if they actually want to help people, they can work with us, and we can deliver what Canadians need to help with the problems they face every day."" Ministers are expected to hear from several guest speakers, including a panel on the state of the economy and the middle class with Canada's chief statistician Anil Arora and economists Armine Yalnizyan and Kevin Milligan. Talks on climate change will include implementing campaign commitments around electric buses, home retrofits and tree planting. Ministers will hold discussions with Andrew Leach, an energy and climate expert at the University of Alberta, and Katharine Hayhoe, a Canadian atmospheric expert at Texas Tech University. There will also be an update on the Trans Mountain pipeline, including engagement efforts with Indigenous peoples. Guest speakers on that issue are Ian Anderson, CEO of Trans Mountain Corporation, William Downe, chair of the board for Trans Mountain Corporation, and Linda Coady, who was named last fall to lead Indigenous engagement on equity for the project. Trudeau is scheduled to meet with Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister and Winnipeg Mayor Bowman, and various ministers will sit down with stakeholder groups in the region. The agenda also includes discussions on health care and a panel of local representatives on regional development and economic competitiveness.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-trudeau-carbon-tax-1.5428312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/minority-report-newsletter-7-cabinet-meeting-trudeau-agenda-1.5431386 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jim-carr-calgary-chamber-first-visit-1.5426455 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/prime-minister-trudeau-winnipeg-bowman-pallister-meeting-1.5431597,/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-trudeau-carbon-tax-1.5428312 /news/canada/manitoba/prime-minister-trudeau-winnipeg-bowman-pallister-meeting-1.5431597 /news/politics/minority-report-newsletter-7-cabinet-meeting-trudeau-agenda-1.5431386 /news/canada/calgary/jim-carr-calgary-chamber-first-visit-1.5426455
89,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-20T21:45:32.750Z,Environment minister calls Maritime Iron's emissions projections 'concerning'  ,"The company pitching an iron processing facility in northern New Brunswick acknowledges in a major regulatory filing that carbon dioxide emissions will increase in the province if the plant goes ahead. Maritime Iron's 490-page registration for a provincial environmental impact assessment, posted online Monday, shows a potential increase of more than two million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over current levels. ""It is a little bit concerning that our emissions will rise when we're trying to be on the other side of that and reduce our emissions here in New Brunswick,"" said Environment Minister Jeff Carr. He said he would have to balance the potential economic boost in the Chaleur region with the likelihood the plant would cause the province to miss its emissions-reduction targets.  The EIA document says by linking the iron plant to NB Power's Belledune generating station, which would burn gas byproduct from the iron plant and reduce its coal consumption, the two facilities would emit a combined 4.9 million tons of greenhouse gases. That's almost double the 2.6 million tons that Belledune now emits alone, and more than the Irving Oil refinery, currently the province's largest emitter. But the document avoids that comparison. Instead, it says the 4.9 million tons of emissions would be less than the 6.5 million total if the Maritime Iron and Belledune plants operated separately.  However that scenario ignores the potential shutdown of Belledune in 2030, when NB Power must phase out coal-fired electricity generation. ""There's some pretty fancy math … which is, 'based in a perfect world, if we were in charge of writing all the regulations, this might be okay,'"" said Lois Corbett of the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. ""But that's not exactly the situation that the climate faces right now. What this project will do is push New Brunswick greenhouse gas pollution way over its current cap."" The province's climate plan includes a target of getting emission to within 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.  The province is very close to that target now. ""I'd like to keep it that way,"" Carr said, conceding any major increase in emissions from a new industrial plant would put the goal in jeopardy. The Maritime Iron proposal was registered in the wake of 420 jobs being lost with the shutdown of the Glencore lead smelter in Belledune. If the project goes ahead, the company says it will create 1,300 direct jobs during construction and 200 permanent jobs during the plant's operations. In its EIA document, Maritime Iron says by supplying the Belledune plant with a gas byproduct as a fuel source, it can help NB Power cut coal consumption there by more than 50 per cent. That would mean Belledune ""can continue beyond 2029"" because reduced coal use will bring it in line with federal regulations, it says. But Carr said that would require what's called an equivalency agreement, in which Ottawa would agree to exempt the plant from the national coal-phaseout deadline in return for equal emissions reductions elsewhere in New Brunswick.  ""I don't think anyone who wants to build a billion-and-a-half-dollar facility should assume that there's going to be an equivalence agreement and there won't be a huge price on carbon by the time this project comes to fruition, ""Corbett said. ""They are writing a project proposal as if there were an agreement in place and that's not their decision. That's the federal government's decision.""  The $1.5 billion iron plant would also be subject to the federal carbon price on large industries, unless Ottawa accepts a proposal from New Brunswick's Progressive Conservative government for an alternative pricing system. NB Power CEO Gaetan Thomas said recently that the utility is working on an equivalency agreement.  If Belledune closed, Maritime Iron's emissions impact alone would be 3.8 million tonnes, still a net increase to the provincial total compared to today.  But it's not clear whether the company's business model is viable if it can't link to the NB Power plant and sell its gas byproduct to the utility.  In the EIA document, a legally required step to win provincial approval, Maritime Iron downplays its potential emissions of greenhouse gases in New Brunswick by urging officials to zoom out to a global perspective. Maritime Iron says its project should be considered ""within a global, national, and provincial context"" that allows it to argue it's climate-friendly. That includes an argument that its Finex technology, a new way of processing iron ore into pig iron, would reduce global emissions by 40 per cent — a figure irrelevant to New Brunswick's emissions target.  Maritime Iron also argues that by shipping Canadian pig iron to markets now using older processing technology, the company ""will be helping the world transition away from jurisdictions that use more energy intensive traditional technologies and that have higher GHG emitting electrical grids.""  It says Canadian iron ore from Quebec is now shipped 28,000 kilometres to China and Korea for processing. The shipping distance to Belledune would be only 425 kilometres, reducing emissions from freighters. At the same time, processed pig iron now shipped to a distribution hub in New Orleans travels 12,000 kilometres from Russia, whereas the trip from Belledune would be 4,500 kilometres. But Canada, and New Brunswick, can't earn any credit for those reductions from shipping emissions because there is no global agreement in place on how to measure and exchange such reductions.  ""We don't get a credit for that on the global scale,"" Carr said. International negotiators tried and failed to reach such a deal in the latest round of global climate negotiations in Madrid in November.  Carr said a technical committee will begin assessing the proposal. He said it's ""anybody's guess"" how long the process will take.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-eia-carbon-emissions-nb-power-belledune-1.5433510,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/belledune-smelter-village-council-maritime-iron-plant-1.5364373 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/iron-processing-plant-carbon-tax-1.5379039 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-plant-belledune-1.5372684,/news/canada/new-brunswick/iron-processing-plant-carbon-tax-1.5379039 /news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-plant-belledune-1.5372684 /news/canada/new-brunswick/belledune-smelter-village-council-maritime-iron-plant-1.5364373

McNeill and over 100 others took part in the annual Women's March in Regina Saturday. Despite the wind chill brushing the -40 C mark, it didn't stop people from coming out. McNeill said she became inspired to fight for women's rights after she witnessed one of her teachers being bullied by her classmates. ""She was ... called sexist things and someone even told her 'No wonder our class isn't learning anything. It's because we're being taught by a girl,'"" said McNeill. ""I wanted to make a difference and support people who go through the same things as she does."" The Regina march is one contingent of many women's marches happening Saturday. Thousands are expected to walk in marches across Canada and around the world. The first event was held in Washington, D.C. in 2017 to send a message advocating for women's rights after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.  Lori Johb helped organize the Regina march. As a healthcare worker, she said she's seen the inequalities women face on a daily basis. It spurred her to take action. ""It's a shame, I think, that we're still fighting for rights that women have died for decades ago,"" Johb said.  Johb said she's marching for women who are victims of violence — especially given that some areas of Saskatchewan have the highest rate of violence against women in the country — as well as missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Holding a sign reading ""He For She,"" Darren Hehn said he was joining his wife, Suzanne, and daughter, Stephanie, in the march because it's important for him to support women's issues. ""As a man I have some responsibility and bear some control and help that I can provide for the cause,"" said Hehn. ""All of us have mothers, sisters, daughters, granddaughters. There's a lot of divisive issues that either women or other minorities face.

Researchers examined data on 51 previously published studies that followed middle-aged and older people in North America, Europe and East Asia for at least several years to see if sleep issues were associated with cognitive health over time. Individuals with insomnia were 27 per cent more likely to develop cognitive problems, the study found. People who had what's known as sleep inadequacy, or an insufficient amount of quality rest, were 25 per cent more likely to develop dementia, the researchers also found. So-called sleep inefficiency, or spending too much time wide awake in bed, was associated with a 24 per cent greater chance of cognitive decline, the study team reports in Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, & Psychiatry. ""These findings suggested that sleep management might serve as a promising target for dementia prevention,"" said lead study author Dr. Wei Xu of Qingdao University in China. While the study wasn't designed to determine whether or how sleep problems directly cause cognitive decline or dementia, there are several possible explanations, Xu said by email. Sleep problems might lead to cognitive impairment by causing inflammation of tissue in the central nervous system including the brain and spinal cord, Xu said. Sleep difficulties might also lead cognitive problems by causing or exacerbating so-called cerebral hypoxia, or a reduction in oxygen supply in the brain, Xu added. In addition, sleep problems could make the brain less efficient at removing waste and contribute to loss of brain cells or atrophy in key regions of the brain. Most of the studies in the current analysis followed participants for anywhere from about three years to 10, and a few tracked people for decades. Participants were typically aged 50 or older at the start of these studies, and they were often in their 70s. Sleep apnea, a nighttime breathing disorder, was associated with a 29 per cent higher risk of cognitive problems, the analysis found. Spending a long time in bed was tied to a 15 per cent greater chance of cognitive impairment. People who slept around six or seven hours a night appeared to have the lowest risk of cognitive disorders, while the risk was elevated for people who slept less than four hours or more than 10 hours a night. It's possible that short sleep and other sleep problems contribute to degeneration in certain brain areas associated with dementia, the study authors note. Or, that people who already have such degeneration tend to sleep longer. Clinical trials are needed to test whether improving sleep quality and quantity affects later dementia risk, they write. Matthew Pase, a researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia who wasn't involved in the study, agreed. ""We still need more evidence to understand whether poor sleep leads to dementia and whether improving sleep can help mitigate risk."" Nevertheless, Pase said by email, ""sleep is vitally important for general health and should be made a priority."" Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep a night, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just because people struggle with sleep, however, doesn't mean they're destined to have cognitive problems, said Dr. Eric Larson of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. ""Insomnia and sleep complaints seem to cause a lot of anxiety that, in my judgment, is unwarranted if its source is brain health,"" Larson, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""But if sleep problems interfere with everyday activities and wellbeing during the day, that's an issue that people should consider raising with their physician."" Getting seven or eight hours of sleep a night also isn't the only way to improve brain health, Larson said. ""The range of `healthy sleep amounts' is highly variable between individuals and becomes more so as people age,"" Larson said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sleep-dementia-1.5429600,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/nap-health-canada-snooze-neurology-napping-snooze-1.5394362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/national-sleep-deprivation-teenagers-youth-learning-1.4929842 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/national-sleep-apnea-health-risks-1.4925252,/news/health/nap-health-canada-snooze-neurology-napping-snooze-1.5394362 /news/health/national-sleep-deprivation-teenagers-youth-learning-1.4929842 /news/health/national-sleep-apnea-health-risks-1.4925252
92,Terence McKenna,2020-01-20T14:36:20.269Z,Internal Boeing messages detail how pressure to cut costs eroded company's renowned safety culture,"Internal messages and emails from Boeing paint a picture of a profit-focused management culture at the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, where pressure for short-term shareholder returns seems to have overwhelmed safety concerns. The revelations are just the latest in a parade of evidence pointing to the decade-long civil-war inside Boeing, pitting its famed ""safety culture"" against financial performance of the kind that pushes the stock price higher and provides big bonuses for senior executives. Longtime Boeing engineer Cynthia Cole, now retired, traces that conflict back to the company's amalgamation with rival McDonnell Douglas in 1997. ""McDonnell Douglas managers were more cutthroat, and it was all about the bottom line — cut those costs!"" she told CBC's The Fifth Estate. ""They didn't follow a good capitalist model. They followed greed and putting people in the upper echelon, putting their interest first above the workers and the product and just society as a whole."" Watch The Fifth Estate's full documentary, How Boeing crashed: The inside story of the 737 Max, Sunday at 9 p.m./9:30 p.m. in NFLD on CBC TV and CBC Gem. The messages showed a concerted effort by employees, under pressure from their managers, to deceive safety regulators from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in an effort to save money and improve short-term financial performance. Internal messages from Boeing employees have described the 737 Max as an airplane ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" The messages were released by the company earlier this month as it copes with congressional criticism and the worldwide grounding of 737 Max planes. ""I don't know how to fix these things … it's systemic,"" one employee wrote. ""It's culture. It's the fact that we have a senior leadership team that understands very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives."" All this came as Boeing faced greater competition from Airbus, which had designed a plane very similar to the 737 Max . Retired Boeing scientist Stan Sorscher agrees with engineer Cynthia Cole. ""In that business model, nobody says no. You're just going to follow the plan. That's the Walmart business model,"" he told The Fifth Estate. The compromise to safety intensified as deregulation became popular in Washington, D.C. The FAA budget was reduced, and much of the safety oversight was subcontracted to staff paid by Boeing. For longtime Boeing engineers and scientists, the conflict of interest was obvious. ""The downside is someone can threaten your position at work,"" said Cole. ""You play ball or else. The managers could tell you to keep your mouth shut or you lose your job."" Sorscher said it's not just salary at stake. ""It's your assignments. You get reassigned to another thing. You can be replaced by someone who is less capable of resisting pressure.""  In one striking email, Boeing's chief technical pilot Mark Forkner bragged about ""Jedi mind-tricking regulators"" to convince them that no serious pilot training was required in the introduction of the 737 Max model.  That would save money for both Boeing and its airline customers. Boeing was so sure that pilot simulator-training wouldn't be required that it had promised Southwest Airlines a rebate of $1 million US per airplane if it was. The desire to avoid pilot training also led Boeing to conceal from pilots the existence of a 737 Max flight-control system called MCAS, the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system.  MCAS was designed to push the plane nose-down to avoid a stall in certain conditions. It has been blamed for the October 2018 crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed 189 people and the March 10, 2019, crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in which 157 died, including 18 Canadians. The system was added to the plane to make it handle more like previous 737 models with smaller engines.  Boeing has been struggling to correct the MCAS system since the last crash, but problems reportedly kept appearing, including some beyond the original software flaws. WATCH | A Boeing 737 simulation shows how MCAS doomed the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610: In December, a leaked email showed that a Transport Canada official suggested simply removing the system from the plane. Pilots would then have to be trained to handle the aircraft without it. Two weeks ago, Boeing finally conceded that pilot simulator-training would be required to return the grounded 737 Max to service. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, is a lonely voice in Washington trying to pressure the U.S. government to rebuild the FAA and re-regulate Boeing, but he can't find a single Republican senator to co-sponsor his bill to do so. Boeing has spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to politicians. ""Well, the system is broken right now,"" Blumenthal told The Fifth Estate, ""because the FAA has to be changed in its culture. It has to end outsourcing, end a system that, in effect, puts the fox in charge of the henhouse and puts safety second, rather than first."" ""The system isn't broken,"" new FAA administrator Steven Dickson said when he appeared before the U.S. Congress in December. He insists the FAA is committed to safety and will be fully satisfied before allowing the 737 Max back into the air. WATCH | Cynthia Cole and Stan Sorscher describe how Boeing operated internally: At the climax of the hearing, however, he had trouble explaining what was done about an internal FAA study showing that there would be over 15 crashes of 737 Max aircraft with 2,920 likely fatalities if the MCAS system was not fixed. That study was completed over three months before the Ethiopian airliner crashed. In his appearances before Congress, then-Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg couldn't explain other internal documents that showed the company was aware long before either crash of the flaws in the MCAS system that lead to the tragedies. One engineering study showed that pilots would have only four seconds to recognize a problem with the flight-control system, and only 10 seconds to respond to it, otherwise there would be a ""catastrophic"" crash. It turns out the Indonesian pilots didn't even know the MCAS system was on the aircraft, and so would be unlikely to recognize a problem with it. Though the FAA issued a warning about the flight control problem that could cause ""impact with terrain,"" the Ethiopian Flight 302 pilots took 35 seconds to recognize the problem and try to correct it. By that time, the plane was in a fatal dive. All the internal warnings made it that much more astonishing that Muilenburg spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump after the second crash and assured him any production pause would be temporary. The fleet was only grounded in the United States three days later, after authorities in China, Europe and Canada had already taken action. Muilenburg has now been fired, walking away with a $62-million US ($81-million Cdn) settlement. The company will likely face severe fines. And there is a U.S. Justice Department investigation of Boeing's relationship with the FAA, but few expect any corporate executives to go to jail. ""I think that all these people in these upper echelons are too related and too intertwined,"" said Cole. ""I don't think they're going to find anything against one of their own. You know, people have died. They've got families, they've got lives that they didn't get to live, and for Boeing to pay a fine or to pay millions or whatever that is, where's the justice?""

94,Anonymous,2020-01-20T22:54:08.421Z,U of S research could make greenhouses in the far north a possibility,"Imagine having sustainable, cost-efficient greenhouses in the far north growing fruits and vegetables. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are trying to make this a reality. ""We have an increasing population on one hand … and because of climate change we are experiencing environmental instability,"" said Nazanin Charchi, a PhD student in chemical engineering at the U of S. ""So it's important to develop a stable, sustainable and more importantly a predictable food supply."" Charchi is using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron on the U of S campus to develop a method to remove the chemical ethylene from the air, to help make a greenhouse viable in harsh environments like Canada's north. ""Basically when the plants grow they produce ethylene,"" said U of S professor Jafar Soltan, who has worked for years in the area of treating polluted air and is overseeing Charchi's work. Soltan said ethylene works like a growth hormone. ""For adults growth hormones are good, but we don't want to give hormones to a six-year-old because they hit puberty sooner than they are supposed to. The same with plants."" In warm climates, excessive ethylene can easily be removed by opening the windows. That's not an option in colder, harsher areas. If you could somehow remove the excess ethylene without opening a window during cold winters, self-contained greenhouses become more cost efficient and sustainable. And that's where Charchi's research comes in. Charchi is using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron to develop a method, or catalyst, to remove ethylene from greenhouses without needing outside air. ""The biggest impact of this research is on reducing energy consumption in those self-contained greenhouses,"" Soltan said. ""The technology that we have removes ethylene in the air inside the greenhouse so you do not need to bring in a lot of air from outside."" That offers the tantalizing prospect of making these self-contained very energy efficient. On top of that, Charchi said being able to remove the excess ethylene means greater longevity for fruits and vegetables that goes bad faster because of ethylene. ""This technology could make greenhouses more environmentally sustainable and less expensive to run. As a result, we could have more food grown in greenhouses in cold regions like Canada and more food security for our families,"" Soltan said. Charchi said they have been successful in being able to use a catalyst to remove ethylene in the lab. She said the next step is to partner with the air conditioning and Hvac industry to develop a commercial application for a  new generation of greenhouses.  Soltan said he foresees the technology being in the form of a small box, similar to a fresh air exchanger, that would be added to the air circulation system. ""It would just continuously get rid of the ethylene and reduce the need to bring in outside air,"" he said. The technology could be adapted to homes and other commercial buildings to reduce energy consumption in those places. When the air is circulating inside a building the technology would get rid of the solvents and smelly chemicals without having to bring in a lot of cold air. Soltan can even see the technology being used in space. ""If you want to grow something in space or travel to Mars or something you want to have a suitable environment for these plants to grow,"" he said. ""We are taking out these hormones that are produced by mature plants and can harm the baby plants. If you remove the hormone you can have a healthy environment for plants to grow, that can be a new way for specially conditioned greenhouses.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-research-greenhouses-far-north-1.5433905,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-research-indoor-air-quality-1.5427912,[]
95,Joel Dryden,2020-01-17T00:08:04.349Z,Don't feel bad for cows grazing in –40 weather — they've got a secret weapon,"Even though the prairies are posting temperatures colder than those found in Antarctica, it's business as usual for local cattle, who bravely stand their ground even as the rest of us retreat indoors. You may feel some empathy for these animals as they stand strong through the deep freeze — but the cow is a durable animal, equipped with certain weaponry finely tuned against even the bleakest winter wind. Exhibit number one: an internal furnace that can't be beat. Cherie Copithorne-Barnes, who ranches west of Calgary, is responsible for feeding that furnace with plenty of coal. ""If you give them enough feed, enough protein and energy, their stomachs generate heat. Even –40 C is no problem as long as they've been given the correct rations and feed to eat,"" she said. The saddest sight of all — cattle standing around in frigid temperatures, covered in ice and snow — is actually a good sign. ""Cows have a layer of fat and hair that acts like insulation that is no different from your house,"" Copithorne-Barnes said. ""When you see them covered in snow, that tells you the heat is not escaping from inside their bodies and that's exactly where you want them to be. ""It's when you see them without that frost and snow in these temperatures when you really have to worry. Because heat is escaping and they're getting cold."" Native grasses will even serve as suitable fuel, Copithorne-Barnes said, as long as farmers have prepared the field ahead of time. ""You need to supply them with a little bit of shelter and the proper feed source,"" she said. ""Water is another important one when it gets this cold."" To no one's surprise, water can be an interesting challenge for ranchers in –40 C weather. ""For sure, we'll cut anywhere from four to six inches of ice off water troughs, even with heat on them,"" Copithorne-Barnes said. ""The cattle will keep it open as they come to feed.  ""You just need to make sure the timing of when you open the water coincides with when they want to come for a drink. It's usually after they've been fed."" But though a cow's digestive system is its best defence against the winter weather, it's not foolproof — so ranchers need to keep a close eye on their livestock when temperatures dip. ""These cattle are our livelihoods. When they are affected negatively, we're affected negatively,"" Copithorne-Barnes said. ""You need to be watching your animals every day to make sure you don't see drastic changes, or if there are individuals that need help."" Particular focus should be paid to those animals that are thin, as they get colder faster compared to those with more fat. Cattle can also lose body weight daily during cold weather, making it extra important to ensure their food supply remains well stocked. In the end, the fact that the animals can survive in unforgiving temperatures really comes down to genetics, Copithorne-Barnes said. ""They have hooves so they can handle the cold. They have hair that grows,"" she said. ""When the genetics aren't there, they don't make it through the winter.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/cows-cattle-cherie-copithorne-barnes-cl-ranches-calgary-1.5428494,[],https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary /news/canada/calgary/albertans-cold-weather-dress-glenbow-archives-meg-furler-1.5427655 /news/canada/calgary/alberta-calgary-edmonton-cold-freeze-weather-penguins-1.5427919 /news/canada/calgary/calgary-cold-photos-1.5428433
96,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:59:09.204Z,China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus,"Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of a new coronavirus, the head of a Chinese government expert team said Monday, as the total number of cases more than tripled and the virus spread to other cities in China. Team leader Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members, state media said. Human-to-human transmission — spread from close contact, some such as among family members — could make the virus spread more quickly and widely, if it spreads easily. The outbreak is believed to have started from people who picked it up at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China.  Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for identifying cases. Four have died. The official Chinese Xinhua News Agency reported that as of 6 p.m. local time on Jan. 20, a total of 224 cases of the new coronavirus infection were reported in China, including 217 confirmed cases: There are also seven suspected cases: two in Sichuan, one in Yunnan Province, two in Shanghai, one in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and one in Shandong Province. In a statement posted on its official Weibo social media account, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 15 medical workers in the city had been diagnosed, with pneumonia with one other suspected case. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition, it added. If health-care workers were not exposed at the seafood market but from an encounter with a patient then that's a signal, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer.  It emphasizes the importance of standard infection prevention and control precautions, Tam said.  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. World Health Organization director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will convene an emergency committee on what it calls the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The committee will meet on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it. Declaring a global health emergency can bring more international attention and aid. WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital, said Monday the key questions about the virus include: ""This may be more widespread in China than it was earlier believed,"" Bogoch said. Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened. Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but fell ill after family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. Bogoch said informing travellers to Canada is important so if anyone coming from China comes down with a respiratory illness knows where to go and what to do to seek care.  Chinese authorities published the genetic sequence of the virus. At Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, scientists have developed a test for the virus, Tam said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035,/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 /news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 /news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619

Earlier Monday, officials said 17 more people in central China have been diagnosed with a new form of viral pneumonia that has killed two patients and placed other countries on alert during a key holiday period. In total, 62 cases of the novel coronavirus have been identified in the city of Wuhan, where the virus appears to have originated. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported the new cases Sunday. Nineteen of those individuals have been discharged from the hospital, while two men in their 60s — one with severe pre-existing conditions — have died from the illness. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. The list includes Thailand and Japan, which have together reported three cases of the disease in people who had come from Wuhan. The new virus belongs in the same large family of coronaviruses that includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak, which also started in China. Though experts say the new virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS, there is little known about its origins and how easily it can spread. Thailand and Japan have confirmed new cases of the virus earlier this week, stoking worries globally as many of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will travel abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin next week. Authorities around the world including in the United States, Thailand and South Korea have stepped up monitoring of travellers from Wuhan as part of their efforts to prevent the disease from spreading. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that a wider outbreak is possible, though it has advised against any travel restrictions for China. U.S. authorities have said they would start screening at three airports — New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport — to detect travellers arriving via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan who may have symptoms of the new virus. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said on Friday it will not implement extra screening measures, but is ""monitoring the situation closely with our partners on both sides of the border."" The CBSA did say there are plans in progress ""to implement signage"" in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal airports to raise awareness of the virus to travellers. The agency says there are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. A report published by the London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely ""substantially more cases"" of the new coronavirus than currently announced by Wuhan authorities; its base scenario estimate is that there would be 1,723 cases showing onset of related symptoms by Jan. 12. The WMHC referred Reuters queries about the report to the National Health Commission (NHC) and the Hubei provincial government, but the NHC and the Hubei government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province. In Asia, authorities in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up monitoring of passengers from Wuhan at airports. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well. But Alexandra Phelan, global health legal expert at Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security, said such screening may be insufficient in preventing the virus from spreading as its symptoms, which include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, are ""quite general.""

Urbanization and rural depopulation is happening in countries like Vietnam, Nigeria or Pakistan, said University of Saskatchewan professor Ken Coates to CBC Radio's Saskatchewan Weekend. ""Rural Canada is in trouble. Many small towns are seeing the population, industries moving out,"" Coates, Canada Research Chair in Regional Innovation, said. ""We're getting mobile work forces, so people are flying in and flying out, rather than living in the northern communities, for example."" Coates said city-states diminish rural populations, the diversity of the human condition and the places to live where people can live the lifestyle they choose, because not everyone wants to live in a big city. He will be speaking at the Saskatoon Club on Monday evening with the presentation Do the 'People Who Don't Matter' have a Future: Prospects and Possibilities for Rural and Small-Town Peoples. Nearly half of Saskatchewan's population alone can be found in either Saskatoon or Regina, the city's two largest population centres. As small towns dwindle in population and industry, there is also a societal loss, such as history and culture from those small towns, the professor added. Coates said Canadians, including those in Saskatchewan, do not seem to be pushing against that trend like they have in other places such as Scandinavia. Innovation is needed to prevent city-states and one of the first avenues for that could be the government reviewing its policies, he said.

101,Anonymous,2020-01-18T20:06:31.262Z,"More than 150 injured after police, protesters clash in Lebanon's capital","Police fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets in Lebanon's capital Saturday to disperse thousands of protesters amid some of the worst rioting since demonstrations against the country's ruling elite erupted three months ago. More than 150 people were injured. The violence began when some protesters started throwing stones at police deployed near the parliament building while others removed street signs and metal barriers and hurled them at security forces. Protesters also threw firecrackers at police. The clashes took place with the backdrop of a rapidly worsening financial crisis and an ongoing impasse over the formation of a new government after the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in late October. Lebanon has witnessed three months of protests against the political elite who have ruled the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war. The protesters blame politicians for widespread corruption and mismanagement in a country that has accumulated one of the largest debt ratios in the world. The protesters had called for a demonstration Saturday afternoon with the theme ""we will not pay the price"" in reference to debt that stands at about $87 billion ($114 billion Cdn), or more than 150 per cent of GDP. As rioting took place in central Beirut, thousands of other protesters arrived later from three different parts of the city to join the demonstration. They were later dispersed and chased by police into nearby Martyrs Square, which has been a centre for protests. Lebanon's Internal Security Forces called on all peaceful protesters to ""immediately leave the area of riots for their own safety."" It added that some policemen who were taken for treatment at hospitals were attacked by protesters inside the medical centres. As clashes continued, some two dozen men believed to be parliament guards attacked the protesters' tents in Martyrs Square, setting them on fire. A gas cylinder inside one of the tents blew up. The fire spread quickly and charred a nearby shop. The bells of nearby St. George Cathedral began to toll in an apparent call for calm, while loudspeakers at the adjacent blue-domed Muhammad Al-Amin mosque called for night prayers. Later in the evening, hundreds of protesters chanting ""Revolution"" chased a contingent of riot police near the entrance of the mosque, forcing them to withdraw. Inside the mosque, several men were treated for gas inhalation and some families were said to be hiding inside. ""We call on the security forces to be merciful with women and children inside the mosque,"" a statement blared through the mosque's loudspeakers. President Michel Aoun called on security forces to protect peaceful protesters and work on restoring clam in downtown Beirut and to protect public and private property. He asked the ministers of defence and interior and heads of security agencies to act. ""The confrontations, fires and acts of sabotage in central Beirut are crazy, suspicious and rejected. They threaten civil peace and warn of grave consequences,"" tweeted Hariri, the caretaker prime minister, who lives nearby. He called those behind the riots ""outlaws"" and called on police and armed forces to protect Beirut. The Lebanese Red Cross said it took 65 people to hospitals and treated 100 others on the spot, calling on people to donate blood. As the clashes continued, more ambulances were seen rushing to the area and evacuating the injured. Late on Saturday most of the protesters were forced out of the area by police firing tear gas and sometimes rubber bullets. Still, security remained tight as more reinforcements arrived. Panic and anger gripped the public as they watched their local currency, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, plummet, losing more than 60 per cent of its value in recent weeks on the black market. The economy has seen no growth and foreign inflows dried up in the already heavily indebted country that relies on imports for most of its basic goods. Meanwhile, banks have imposed informal capital controls, limiting withdrawal of dollars and foreign transfers. Earlier this week, protesters carried out acts of vandalism in a main commercial area in Beirut targeting mostly private banks. Adding to the crisis, Lebanon has been without a government since Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned Oct. 29, meeting a key demand of the protesters. Prime minister-designate Hassan Diab had been expected to announce an 18-member cabinet on Friday, but last minute disputes among political factions scuttled his latest attempt.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-protests-1.5431739,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-beirut-economy-protests-margaret-evans-1.5421371,/news/world/lebanon-beirut-economy-protests-margaret-evans-1.5421371
102,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-19T15:59:04.399Z,Lametti says assisted dying bill to be tabled in February,"Justice Minister David Lametti plans to table new legislation next month amending the criteria for Canadians to have medical assistance in dying. Speaking to reporters before a Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, Lametti said more than 150,000 people have already participated in the government's online survey. Roundtables have been held in cities across the country, and there will also be outreach in the territories. ""There's a diversity of opinion, but a lot of interesting and specific and concrete suggestions in terms of meeting the criterion of the Quebec Superior Court,"" he said. In September, a Quebec judge declared parts of the federal and provincial laws on assisted dying unconstitutional, and gave the federal government six months to pass new legislation. Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin said one portion of the federal law — requiring that a patient must face a ""reasonably foreseeable"" death before seeking medical assistance in dying — violated Canadians' charter rights.  Lametti left the door open to seeking an extension on passing the legislation. ""My goal is to get a draft bill in front of the House of Commons during the month of February, and then we'll see. We'll see where we are in terms of our colleagues around the table in the House of Commons and across the aisle, see what kind of support we have for the bill that's there,"" he said. ""We haven't ruled out the possibility of asking for an extension, but for the time being my priority is getting that bill in front of the House."" Lametti said the calendar for drafting the legislation was challenged by the federal election, the time to appoint cabinet and the holiday season, but he will do his best to succeed in meeting the mid-March deadline imposed by the court. Given the time crunch, Canadians were given just two weeks to take part in the online survey One of the survey questions asks whether it should be mandatory for a patient to receive a third medical consultation with an expert before receiving permission to obtain a medically assisted death. The survey also asks whether the federal government should change the length of the current 10-day ""reflection period"" between requesting and receiving a medically assisted death. The government is also considering input on whether the updated law should allow advance requests, access for so-called ""mature minors"" who doctors consider capable of making their own decisions on medical care, and whether psychiatric conditions should be grounds for assisted death. The government commissioned three independent reports on those issues, which were submitted to the government more than a year ago by the Council of Canadian Academies, a group that pulls together experts to consider public policy. Lametti said the new legislation must find the right balance between meeting the needs of people who want medical assistance in dying, and protecting vulnerable persons.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medically-assisted-death-lametti-1.5432519,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/consultations-medical-aid-in-dying-1.5422850 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medical-aid-in-dying-response-1.5426564 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/maid-assisted-death-minors-mental-illness-1.4956388,/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244 /news/politics/medical-aid-in-dying-response-1.5426564 /news/politics/consultations-medical-aid-in-dying-1.5422850 /news/politics/maid-assisted-death-minors-mental-illness-1.4956388 /news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890 www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cons/ad-am/index.html
103,Anonymous,2020-01-18T21:48:51.078Z,More residents eligible for compensation after Shannon water contamination,"More residents of Shannon, Que., are eligible for compensation for a water contamination that some say gave them deadly cancer. The Quebec Court of Appeals has widened the scope of a judgment that ordered the federal government and two private companies — Valcartier Real Estate Corporation and General Dynamics — to pay citizens who suffered damage from the contamination. Trichloroethylene (TCE), commonly used as a degreasing agent, was discovered to have leached into the drinking water supply system at the nearby Valcartier base in 1997. Three years later, it was detected in private wells in neighbouring Shannon. Previously, only residents who lived in the ""red triangle"" — where the TCE levels were found to be the highest — were eligible for compensation.  Now, residents who resided in certain areas as early as 1995 and as late as 2006 could be eligible. The maximum amount claimants can receive also increased, from $15,000 to $63,000. But it's a bittersweet victory, said the citizens' group representing Shannon residents. ""It was recognized that [the defendants] contaminated the water, it's flagrant,"" said Jean Bernier, a member of the group. ""But they didn't recognize the causality between the contamination and the cancers."" ""To fail at proving the causality, for me, I'm still a little bitter,"" added Marie-Paule Spieser, who is also a member of the group. ""It was an arduous end to the recourse.""  One medical analysis concluded that some residents of the town have a greatly elevated risk of developing cancer of the kidney and liver, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The judges ruled that even if there was a scientific causal link between the TCE contamination and cancer, it did not meet the burden of proof required by the court.  That meant the compensation offered was for the contamination itself and not for any illnesses contracted as a result. The group said it was also disappointed that residents who were minors at the time are not eligible for compensation. Residents said they may pursue more legal action.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/water-contam-shannon-1.5432129,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/shannon-liver-cancer-tce-contamination-1.3525497,/news/canada/montreal/shannon-water-cancer-risks-1.3428746 /news/canada/montreal/judge-rules-no-cancer-link-in-shannon-que-water-contamination-case-1.1174150

105,Amy Smart,2020-01-18T21:34:10.574Z,Wet'suwet'en elder calls for dialogue as pipeline polarizes some in northern British Columbia,"A natural gas pipeline project has polarized many communities across northern British Columbia in a dispute a Wet'suwet'en elder says he hopes will be resolved through dialogue. Russell Tiljoe, 83, has long-established ties with the First Nation whose hereditary clan chiefs say the Coastal GasLink project has no authority to run through its 22,000 square kilometres of traditional territory without their consent. His own late father was one of the clan chiefs, but Tiljoe is not a hereditary chief because he said the governance system is traced through the female family line. ""I'm honestly sitting in the middle and not taking sides,"" Tiljoe said in an interview from Houston, B.C., the nearest town to a Coastal GasLink site at the centre of the dispute. Coastal GasLink is building the 670-kilometre pipeline from British Columbia's northeast to Kitimat on the coast. The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along its path, but the hereditary clan chiefs who are leaders under the traditional form of governance say the project has no authority without their consent. Last year, the conflict inspired rallies across the country when RCMP enforced an injunction and arrested 14 supporters of the hereditary chiefs who blocked access to a logging road leading to the work site on Wet'suwet'en traditional territory. The B.C. Supreme Court expanded the injunction Dec. 31 and the hereditary clan chiefs responded with an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink, leading to a new standoff. Tiljoe said he hopes the dispute doesn't come down to a physical confrontation and that it can be resolved through dialogue between the Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs and the provincial government, as well as between the hereditary chiefs and those who are elected to administer reserves. ""It may take a long time to be able to come to a consensus agreement, but it is there, we just have to find it,"" he said. Tiljoe said the project has created some tension in the community. Four years ago, he said he spoke in favour of considering the potential economic benefits of the project at a meeting in the feast hall, where Wet'suwet'en decisions are made under the traditional governance structure. ""Since then, there are a lot of people who will have nothing to do with me. If I'm not against it, then I'm for it, the way they see it,"" he said. The hereditary clan chiefs have made it clear they will never support the project. At the other end of the spectrum, Premier John Horgan declared this week that the provincially permitted project will be built, and the rule of law must prevail. Everyone, from the chiefs to the company and the RCMP talk about their commitment to dialogue, but so far dialogue hasn't solved the impasse. Na'moks, a spokesman for the hereditary clan chiefs who also goes by John Ridsdale, suggested that expecting full agreement within any community is unrealistic, just as it is at any other level of government. ""Why do you think there are three elected parties, do you think they all get along?"" Still, he said the number of Wet'suwet'en members who support the project is ""quite small and limited,"" compared with local opponents. Coastal GasLink says the hereditary clan chiefs have not responded to requests to meet, while Na'moks has said the chiefs will only meet with leaders in the provincial and federal governments. The project has also divided non-Indigenous neighbours of the Wet'suwet'en and local leaders are being cautious about how they talk about the project. Local MLA Doug Donaldson declined an interview request, deferring to Horgan's comments. New Democrat MP Taylor Bachrach, who represents the sprawling northwest corner of the province, including the area of dispute as well as several communities that support it, would not say if he supports the pipeline or opposes it. ""This is a really difficult and divisive issue for our communities and our region,"" he said, adding his focus is on safety and encouraging open communication. Bachrach said he's hopeful disagreements, like how RCMP operate in the area, can be resolved through negotiation. ""At the same time, there are big unanswered questions at the heart of this issue, and I don't think those larger questions are likely to be answered in the coming days."" Since Bachrach made those comments, RCMP set up a checkpoint with a stated intention to prevent the dispute on the road from escalating, but the checkpoint itself has become the subject of a complaint by the B.C. Civil Liberties Association after two people were denied entry. Gladys Atrill, the acting mayor of Smithers, a town about 45 minutes from the entrance to the logging road, said council is also not taking a position on the project, although it has a good working relationship with the hereditary chiefs whose office is their town. She said some members of the community are employed by Coastal GasLink or its contractors but couldn't say if the division of opinion lands for or against the pipeline. There are strong views on either side but also a ""milieu of people in the middle,"" and she believes the majority of people are most concerned about safety, Atrill added. ""Smithers is a diverse community. It's a huge strength in community but of course it means people see things differently."" Atrill said she hopes those directly involved in the conflict ""hold fast, be cautious,"" and remember that safety is primary. ""I would rather we take a little more time than do something we might regret,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wet-suwet-en-elder-calls-for-dialogue-as-pipeline-polarizes-some-in-northern-british-columbia-1.5432262,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-life-changing-jobs-first-nations-haisla-1.5427666 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-checkpoint-coastalgaslink-wetsuweten-1.5427015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-project-sitka-list-1.5422152 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-pipeline-horgan-british-columbia-1.5425745 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-human-rights-commissioner-calls-on-canada-to-stop-eviction-of-wet-suwet-en-people-in-pipeline-standoff-1.5423639,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/summer-winter-m-s-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-tires-when-it-snows-1.5432005 /news/canada/british-columbia/contentious-jumbo-valley-to-become-indigenous-protected-area-with-21m-fund-1.5431665 /news/canada/british-columbia/sechelt-residents-angered-by-logging-activity-on-neighbouring-property-1.5430029

111,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-12-09T01:00:00.670Z,Car owner forced to replace engine twice within weeks despite safety recall,"A B.C. man says he's in ""disbelief"" after learning he'll have to swallow the cost of replacing his SUV's engine — not once, but twice, within weeks — despite the vehicle being part of a major recall that was issued before the breakdowns. And he's not the only one facing thousands of dollars in repair bills for vehicles under recall. In June, Rick Lingard's 2011 Hyundai Tucson's engine seized and died while he was driving down a major highway near Cranbrook, B.C. ""They showed me the engine after they took it out and there was a hole in it. It was destroyed,"" said Lingard, who lives in Nelson.  He paid more than $7,000 to replace it, opting for a used engine with 40,000 kilometres on it, through an independent mechanic, after a Hyundai dealership quoted him more than $10,000 for a new one. A few weeks later, it happened again. ""The same kind of high-pitched rattle-y sound … and then all the lights came on again and — boom! I was in disbelief,"" he told Go Public. Then, another twist: Just three days after the second catastrophic engine failure, Lingard got a recall notice describing the same problem. The recall was issued in February, but the notice didn't arrive in the mail until August. Lingard says no one at two Hyundai dealerships he'd contacted about his engine breakdowns mentioned anything about a recall. ""To me, it's just irresponsible to the core,"" he said. Transport Canada could easily fix the problem, according to one automotive consumer advocate, by forcing Hyundai to cover Lingard's costs. But the federal agency, says George Iny of the Automotive Protection Association, tends not to use the full extent of its powers.  The agency also has the power to force recalls — under changes made last year to the Motor Vehicle Safety Act — but has never used it.  ""Transport Canada is a bit like an out-of-shape person who just got a gold-plated membership to the gym. That doesn't automatically put you in shape,"" said Iny. ""Transport Canada needs to act more assertively."" After getting the recall notice, Lingard submitted his receipts to Hyundai Canada. It rejected the claim, saying his first engine failure was due to ""insufficient engine maintenance, not the recall"" because Lingard didn't do sufficiently frequent oil changes prior to 100,000 kilometres of driving, and didn't provide receipts for subsequent changes.  The company says he changed his oil every 20,000 kilometres instead of every 12,000 as required by the manual. After the warranty expired, Lingard says he stopped going to the dealership for oil changes.  Iny says using oil changes as a reason to deny claims is common but puzzling.  ""The fact that you didn't keep records of oil changes doesn't make you negligent. That's just an invention,"" Iny said. ""It's not a valid reason for refusing coverage.""  He says both Kia and its part-owner Hyundai have admitted, in some cases, that such engine failures stem from metallic debris left inside during the manufacturing process.  In those cases, ""whether you did oil changes or not,"" Iny said, ""the debris was already there."" Lingard's recall notice doesn't mention debris.  Hyundai Canada also denies responsibility for Lingard's second blown engine because, according to a spokesperson, the engine was not ""provided, installed or inspected by a Hyundai dealer."" When Go Public asked why his recall notice took months to arrive, and why no one at the company told Lingard about the recall, it didn't respond.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they, too, are being left out of the recall. Scott Wild and his wife Donna Stewart, of Cambridge, Ont., experienced the same dangerous breakdown as Lingard, when the engine of their 2013 Kia Sportage suddenly failed at high speeds on June 4. Their mechanic also found a hole had been blown in the side of the engine and it needed to be replaced. ""I said, 'You can't be serious … this vehicle has 140,000 kilometres on it and it's finally paid off,'"" Wild said. That's when the couple discovered there's a recall on the 2013 Kia Sportage, but their specific vehicle isn't covered. Kia told them their vehicle identification number was not listed under the recall.  ""It was really weird, "" said Wild. ""What happened to our vehicle is exactly the same as what happens to all the vehicles that are on the list."" Kia Canada told Go Public that the couple's vehicle had an MPI (""multi-point injection"") engine — and only those with GDI (""gasoline direct injection"") engines are part of the recalls.  What's the difference? When Go Public asked, the company didn't answer. But independent mechanic Chris Solodko, in Hamilton, told Go Public he's repaired dozens of both types and, in his opinion, their engine problems are almost identical. ""They all have the same noise, the same problem. One [type of engine] is running on a high pressure and the other one is running on a low pressure,"" he said.  Transport Canada told Go Public it has received 65 complaints of engine failures not covered by the Kia and Hyundai recalls since March and says it is investigating whether more vehicles should be added. Iny says they have to move faster. ""There is a pattern here. What we need of the carmakers is an open mind that the complaints that fall outside of the group are not just turned down but that they are looked into,"" he said. Wild and Stewart ended up selling their vehicle for parts, then joined one of at least four Canadian, engine-related class-action lawsuits against Kia and Hyundai. The lawsuits have not yet been certified by the courts.  Both Hyundai and Kia have been dogged with engine failure and fire complaints and lawsuits in Canada and the U.S. Hyundai and Kia have recalled almost 500,000 vehicles in Canada for engine-related defects since 2015, due to manufacturing debris that could cause the engines to fail. The problem can also cause fires. Millions of other vehicles have been recalled in the U.S. and, in October, the companies agreed to set aside $758 million US to settle related class-actions in the U.S. and South Korea, pending approval by the courts. Iny is hopeful a U.S. settlement might mean one is coming for drivers in Canada, but it could be a while before that happens — if at all. ""We would want total parity,"" he said. In the meantime, Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a safety-related problem with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Wild and Stewart have filed complaints with Transport Canada. They are waiting to see what the agency decides. ""Zero compassion. Zero empathy. Zero everything,"" Wild said about his interaction with Kia staff. ""Basically, 'Sorry about your luck.'""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hyundai-kia-engine-failure-recalls-1.5382373,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/car-owners-claim-they-were-knowingly-sold-defective-vehicles-1.5073563 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/father-outraged-after-engine-fire-puts-family-at-risk-1.5064230 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/car-maintenance-kia-hyundai-oil-change-1.5309293 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/calls-for-answers-from-hyundai-kia-following-recalls-1.5200078 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/car-giants-delay-recall-on-engine-known-to-fail-1.5044866,/news/business/car-owners-claim-they-were-knowingly-sold-defective-vehicles-1.5073563 /news/business/father-outraged-after-engine-fire-puts-family-at-risk-1.5064230 /news/business/car-maintenance-kia-hyundai-oil-change-1.5309293 /news/business/calls-for-answers-from-hyundai-kia-following-recalls-1.5200078 /news/business/car-giants-delay-recall-on-engine-known-to-fail-1.5044866

113,Anonymous,2020-01-20T15:06:14.915Z,Day 3 of search underway for N.L. man who went missing in storm,"A scaled-back ground search is resuming for Joshua Wall, who has not been heard from since walking into a raging Newfoundland blizzard that brought record amounts of snow on Friday afternoon. For a third day, police officers and volunteer search and rescue specialists with the Avalon North Wolverines will be scouring the terrain near the Conception Bay community of Roaches Line. ""They are here. They are mobilizing now,"" Wayne Wall, Joshua's father, said Monday morning. Unlike Saturday and Sunday, however, there are no plans to deploy a helicopter, said RCMP civilian spokesperson Glenda Power. Searchers are assessing whether there's a need to recall air support to the area, she added. Power said the strategy Monday is to widen the search beyond the known trails in the wilderness area between Roaches Line and the community of Marysvale. Joshua has now been missing for three full days, and his family remains hopeful that he found some type of shelter and will be rescued. ""My son is out there somewhere. He's most likely cold. Hopefully he's hung up into a shelter,"" Wayne told CBC's Kayla Hounsell on Sunday. The search was delayed Monday morning by another overnight snowfall, with 10-plus centimetres, followed by drizzle, complicating search efforts. Joshua Wall has been dealing with anxiety, and was not feeling well Friday morning, said his father.  By early afternoon, Wayne Wall said, his son was feeling better, and decided to walk to a friend's house in Marysvale, a distance of 10 kilometres by road. It was later learned that Joshua decided to enter the woods and travel along a backcountry trail. His last known communication was on Friday at 1 p.m., when he messaged his location to his friend, and writing that he was lost and his phone battery was low. An official search could not be mobilized until Saturday because of record amounts of snow and heavy drifting that prevented police and volunteers from reaching the scene. When asked how long police will continue the search, Power said an assessment will be made at the end of the day. ""At this point, there is no talk of ending the search,"" she said. ""But it is now Day 4 since he's been missing, and we'll carefully make that decision."" At its peak, there were 40 people searching for Joshua, said Power. Meanwhile, Power urged area residents to check their properties, and any buildings in which Joshua might have sought shelter from the storm.

Back in Canada after meeting in Oman with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to discuss the disaster that occurred near Tehran, Champagne said he is aware of media reports that Iran is backtracking on its pledge to share the flight recorders for independent analysis. ""When you say to the world you take full responsibility, that comes with consequences,"" Champagne told reporters at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. ""What I did say to the Iranian foreign minister is that the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, is that the black [boxes] be sent quickly either to Ukraine or to France. In light of new reports that suggest Iran may be wavering, Champagne reached out to his counterpart today to make the point again. ""I wrote this morning to my Iranian counterpart to stress again the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, and I would think the wish of the international community that the black [boxes] be sent where [they] should be sent,"" he said. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted the head of the accident investigation board of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Hassan Rezaeifar saying Iranian experts are examining the black boxes. ""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" the agency reported him saying. The black boxes contain the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and have information that is critical for understanding the sequence of events around the crash. Iran has conceded it launched a missile attack that struck down the Ukrainian airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. There were 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada among the dead. Champagne said the repatriation process continues for the remains, and the wishes of the family are being respected on whether they want their loved ones to be returned to Canada or stay in Iran. ""In the interests of privacy, I won't go into too much detail ... but I can tell you that the wishes of the family are paramount and we will ensure this is the case in all cases,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to meet with some family members of the crash victims on Monday evening in Winnipeg. On Friday, Trudeau announced that the government would provide $25,000 per victim to assist families in the aftermath of the disaster, while insisting Iran must provide compensation.

115,Brandie Weikle,2020-01-19T01:47:51.116Z,3 misconceptions about retirement in Canada,"A new report found that the reality of retirement in Canada isn't quite what people expect it to be. The online poll of 1,800 people conducted by Ipsos on behalf of RBC revealed notable misconceptions surrounding retirement. They include the timing of that last day on the job and how Canadians actually spend their days after clocking out. Respondents were Canadians 55 years and older, some in their pre-retirement years and others who have already retired. An important caveat is that all said they have retirement assets of $100,000 or more. ""Our expectations for retirement aren't always met,"" said Rick Lowes, vice president of retirement strategy of RBC. Here are the three common misconceptions highlighted in the report. So much for counting down the days to retirement months in advance. Among the survey respondents, 55 per cent expected to know their retirement date a year or more in advance. But just 39 per cent had that much notice. In fact, 16 per cent had no advance notice of their retirement. The results varied from province to province: Respondents in Atlantic Canada were the most likely to say they had no notice before their retirement day arrived.  Marissa Lennox, chief policy officer for CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, said health is the No. 1 reason people end up retiring earlier than expected. ""People in bad health often overestimate how long they can work,"" she said. ""The second reason is familial issues. Someone may choose to leave the workforce to care for a parent, spouse or grandchild."" Mandatory retirement ages are no longer legal, but things like lay-offs, restructuring, and redundancy brought about by technology also push people into retirement with little notice, Lennox said. Retiring to sunnier climes is a common Canadian dream. Close to a third of poll respondents said they expect to be ""snowbirds"" who spend the winter months in warmer locations such as Florida, Arizona or Mexico. But of those respondents who had actually retired, just 18 per cent actually fly south for winter. That stat doesn't surprise Lennox.  ""The fact is while it's nice to fantasize about retiring in a little beach town in paradise somewhere, or spending the better half of our lives travelling the world, it's just not realistic for most,"" she said. The survey found that those from Alberta were the most likely to be snowbirds at 32 per cent, followed by retirees from Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 23 per cent. Many Canadians plan to have some sort of second act in retirement, working either full or part-time once their main career has come to an end. In fact, they may be counting on it to pay the bills, said Lowes. Among the poll's respondents who hadn't yet retired, 50 per cent said they expected to work at least part-time but just 11 per cent of retirees polled said they'd found work. ""If we haven't had early notice of retirement, and we haven't got plans in place, and we may be relying on work to help us achieve our goals, that may not be as available as we'd hoped,"" he said. Retirees may discover that it's harder to get a job than expected, or at least the kind they'd hoped for that will accommodate a semi-retired lifestyle. Edmonton retiree Ernie Zelinski, author of How to Retire Happy Wild and Free, said people may discover that the type of work they can get in retirement isn't worth it. ""If you've been making a job at $120,000 a year and then you lose your job at 55 and then you have to work a job at $15 an hour, is that going to be sufficient? Those factors have to come into effect too. Would you enjoy being a Walmart greeter or anything else that may be available to you?"" Lennox said she questioned the report's finding about the small portion of working retirees, given the number of CARP members who say they count on income from part-time work. However, she said one explanation could be that since so many are retiring later in life, their ability and desire to work once they've finally hung up their hats isn't what they expected. ""The trend is that people are retiring in their 70s and 80s, so the likelihood of going back to work after that point is much lower,"" Lennox said. ""We're thinking of the traditional retirement age of 55 or even 65, and that's just not what's happening today.""  The findings are part of a poll that was conducted between April 2 and April 8, 2019. For this report, the data is drawn from a sample of 1,800 people age 50 or more who have retirement assets of $100,000 or more. The results are considered accurate to within +/- 2.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/misconceptions-retirement-in-canada-1.5430889,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/semi-retirement-baby-boomers-1.4990110,[]
116,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-16T23:55:54.476Z,Supreme Court dismisses B.C.'s bid to save bill blocking Trans Mountain project,"The Supreme Court of Canada has dismissed B.C.'s appeal of a lower court decision that quashed provincial legislation designed to block the Trans Mountain expansion project. In a unanimous decision, Chief Justice Richard Wagner said the court will let the B.C. Court of Appeal decision stand. The decision clears yet another legal hurdle for the long-delayed pipeline project. A separate Federal Court of Appeals case on the project, which considers Indigenous issues, is still pending. The decision, issued from the bench on the same day legal counsel delivered oral arguments, is a blow to B.C. Premier John Horgan, who has sought to stop construction of the expansion. If built, the pipeline will carry nearly a million barrels of oil from Alberta's oilpatch to the B.C. coast each day for export to Asian markets. Horgan promised in the 2017 election campaign ""to use every tool in our tool box to stop"" the construction of the Trans Mountain expansion. The court's ruling was not unexpected, given how poorly the B.C. case fared in front of the justices Thursday. The B.C. NDP government had drafted amendments to provincial environmental law to all but ban interprovincial shipments of heavy oil — bitumen and diluted bitumen — and other ""hazardous substances"" through pipelines, including the Crown-owned Trans Mountain expansion project. The amendments would have required companies transporting these substances through B.C. to first obtain provincial permits. In a statement, Horgan said he was disappointed by the decision, which effectively ends the province's litigation. ""This does not reduce our concerns regarding the potential of a catastrophic oil spill on our coast. When it comes to protecting our coast, our environment and our economy, we will continue do all we can within our jurisdiction,"" he said. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, meanwhile, called the decision a ""big win"" for his province. ""This could not be a stronger affirmation of Alberta's position,"" he said. ""I really believe 2020 is going to be a good year, a turnaround year, for Alberta."" Despite Horgan's 2017 promise to use all the provincial levers available to stop the project, Joseph Arvay, the lawyer representing the attorney general of B.C., insisted Thursday the proposed permits were not designed to target Trans Mountain. He said the proposed law was designed rather to protect the environment by guarding against spills. However, the B.C. regime did not target bitumen transported by ship. ""The only concern the premier, the attorney general and the members of the government have had is the harm of bitumen. It's not about pipelines. They're not anti-pipelines, they're not anti-Alberta, they're not anti-oilsands, they're not anti-oil,"" Arvay said. Bitumen is a molasses-like liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. Environmentalists maintain diluted bitumen is difficult to clean up in the event of a spill on or near water. Most of the justices — Malcolm Rowe, Rosalie Abella, Russell Brown, Andromache Karakatsanis and Nicholas Kasirer — questioned the province's authority to enact legislation on a matter that so clearly falls under federal jurisdiction. The top court echoed many of arguments made by the five judges on the B.C. Court of Appeal, who ruled unanimously last spring that the Horgan government stepped into federal jurisdiction by imposing conditions on a project that crosses provincial boundaries. Under section 92(10) of the Constitution, interprovincial projects like Trans Mountain are exclusively the purview of the federal government. That section stipulates that ""lines of Steam or other Ships, Railways, Roads, Telegraphs, and other Works and Undertakings connecting the Province with any other or others of the Provinces"" are Ottawa's responsibility. Rowe said B.C. is trying to block a project legitimately approved by the federal government. ""This [B.C.] legislation is about taking away the ability of the Government of Canada to effectively approve interprovincial pipelines that pass through B.C. carrying anything,"" Rowe said. Abella said interprovincial pipeline approvals are ""unquestionably a federal undertaking."" Brown described the B.C. permitting regime as a deliberate attempt to usurp Ottawa's jurisdiction. The pile-on by the justices over B.C.'s legal rationale was so intense that, by day's end, Arvay conceded the obvious: he likely wasn't going to win the appeal. ""If I'm not going to win the appeal, I don't want to lose badly,"" he said in his final reply. The Trans Mountain expansion project went through a years-long federal review by the National Energy Board (NEB) and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and has been approved by the federal Liberal cabinet — twice. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the project is in the national interest and would help deliver Canadian oil to tidewater for shipment to lucrative markets in Asia, reducing price pressures on Alberta oil producers. ""If you have a pipeline and you can't put anything through it, it's totally useless. That frustrates the federal permitting process does it not?"" Rowe said Thursday. ""Today, it's heavy oil. Tomorrow, it could be anything else."" Brown said B.C.'s law ""effectively allows the province to regulate the design and operation of an interprovincial operation,"" a constitutional no-no given how explicit the document is on interprovincial matters. Ecojustice lawyer Harry Wruck, an intervener in the case, said environmental concerns should override other constitutional considerations. ""Environmental protection underpins the whole Constitution. Without a viable environment we cannot have a Constitution, we cannot have a nation based on laws, we cannot have institutions, we cannot have a society, in effect,"" Wruck said. ""What we're saying [is] environmental protection is an underlying constitutional principle that must inform the division of power analysis,"" he added, citing the constitutional division of federal and provincial jurisdictions. Jan Brongers, the lawyer representing the Attorney General of Canada, asked the Supreme Court today to dismiss the B.C. appeal because the proposed environmental amendments are ultra vires, or beyond the province's jurisdiction. Brongers said the federal government is also concerned about environmental protection and has its own regulations in place to guard against a potential spill. He said B.C. has overreached. ""Your point is the province is reaching into the federal toolbox because their toolbox doesn't do the job?"" Brown asked Brongers. ""Yes. They're trying to regulate the same subject for the same purpose, but they have different notions for what's required,"" Brongers replied. Justice Michael Moldaver described the B.C. bill as an attempt to ""throw up barriers that will, at a minimum, delay or obstruct"" a project approved by the federal cabinet. Rowe said siding with B.C. in this case would be devastating to interprovincial commerce. ""There will be nothing. The uncertainty will kill the business case,"" he said. Brown, Karakatsanis and Rowe questioned the environmental protection argument because the legislation doesn't address the transport of heavy oils by other means — by ship, for example — or existing heavy oil shipments that move through the province. Karakatsanis noted that the province already has environmental legislation — the Environmental Management Act — that can be applied in the event of a spill. Abella said there's no question a province can enact environmental protection legislation, but the question before the court is whether this legislation protects the environment in a way that interferes with clear constitutional boundaries. Arvay argued that the division of powers does not amount to ""watertight compartments"" — and courts previously have recognized that certain functions are best carried out by the level of government closest to the people affected. Federal Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan welcomed the court's ruling Thursday. ""It is a core responsibility of the federal government to help get Canada's resources to market and support good, middle class jobs,"" he said in a media statement. ""We know this is only possible when we earn public trust and work to address environmental, Indigenous peoples' and local concerns, which we are doing every step of the way on TMX.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supreme-court-bc-reference-trans-mountain-1.5429423,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-western-canada-trans-mountain-1.5332365 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trans-mountain-bc-ruling-reaction-kenney-notley-court-restrict-shipments-1.5148866 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trans-mountain-bc-appeal-court-government-response-1.5148568 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-legislation-unfairly-targets-trans-mountain-project-proponent-argues-1.5066235,/news/politics/trudeau-western-canada-trans-mountain-1.5332365 /news/canada/calgary/trans-mountain-bc-ruling-reaction-kenney-notley-court-restrict-shipments-1.5148866 /news/canada/british-columbia/trans-mountain-bc-appeal-court-government-response-1.5148568 /news/canada/british-columbia/bc-legislation-unfairly-targets-trans-mountain-project-proponent-argues-1.5066235

The 47-year-old says her doctors told her the problems were part of routine healing, but as the weeks passed, the pain and smell got worse. Finally, a friend convinced Wallace to show up at her surgeon's waiting room, and just sit there until the doctor agreed to see her. When the surgeon finally examined Wallace, the problem was apparent and ""horrifying.""  ""She put her gloves on and reached in and took a glove and two sponges out of my body,"" said Wallace. As Go Public recently reported, the number of objects being left in patients after surgery in Canada has jumped 14 per cent over the last five years.  That's no accident, but a systemic problem caused by doctors and nurses being pressured to rush through surgeries, according to veteran surgical nurse Bev McLean.  McLean has spent more than half of her 33-year career in operating rooms, as a nurse, among other positions, and, most recently, reviewing operating room mistakes for legal cases. She says Wallace's story reminds her of a case she reviewed in 2010. In a rush to finish an operation, a surgeon grabbed a sponge from the instrument table after a nurse had finished counting medical devices to ensure all were accounted. The sponge was lost in the count and left inside the patient. It was only discovered after he developed a painful infection and required another surgery to be removed, says McLean. In an effort to reduce wait times and cut costs, many provinces cap funding for certain kinds of surgeries, no matter how complicated or what problems arise. At the same time, the provinces require hospitals to balance their budgets, resulting in a crackdown on overtime and adding to the pressure to rush through surgeries. ""There's a big push these days to be fast,"" McLean told Go Public, ""and that's part of the problem. The faster you go in any procedure, no matter how good you are as a team, there's always the risk that you're going to take a shortcut or that you might miss a step, or you're doing two steps at the same time."" The Canadian Nurses Association and the Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada say they too see this as part of the problem. Asked what it's doing about the problem, Health Canada said in an email ""the practice of medicine"" is up to the provinces.  There are oversights and safety measures in place. Accreditation Canada, an independent agency that sets standards for publicly funded hospitals, made it mandatory in 2011 for surgical staff to count the devices — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — used after a procedure to ensure nothing is left behind. This kind of medical mistake is considered a ""never event,"" meaning there are enough safety measures in place that it should never happen. But despite that, it does. Alberta and Quebec have the highest rates of leaving foreign objects inside patients, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Both are above the national average of 9.8 such mistakes per 100,000 patients: Alberta at 12 and Quebec at 15 per 100,000 patients. A spokesperson for Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services tells Go Public, such ""omissions remain very rare,"" adding operating room staff need to be vigilant and follow best practices. Alberta Health Services recently finished a comprehensive review of what's causing these errors, and found the ""primary factors identified are distractions, incorrect surgical tool counts and challenges with surgical team dynamics,"" according to spokesperson Kerry Williamson. Williamson says there is no single, identifiable reason why Alberta's rates are higher, but that it's likely due to the province's good reporting system. In Ontario, hospitals are required to report to the Ministry of Health on their use of the instrument checklist — which has shown to ""reduce the rates of death and complications,"" according to ministry spokesperson David Jensen. The ministry noted the province's rate of left-behind medical devices is lower than the national average, but would not comment on whether the funding model or the pressure to balance hospital budgets is leading to rushed operations.  In some parts of Canada, including Toronto and Ottawa, evidence about medical errors is being gathered in operating rooms equipped with ""black box"" recorders, similar to those in airplanes, providing a window on what can go wrong. The boxes include cameras and microphones that monitor what's being said and done in operating rooms, analysis of which shows distractions like loud noises, irrelevant conversations and doors opening and closing may be leading to medical mistakes. The Toronto doctor behind the project, Teodor Grantcharov, has been testing the boxes for almost four years.  Noises distracted surgeons a median of 138 times per surgery according to findings released in June 2018.  Misplaced medical devices are part of the broader problem of ""preventable patient harm incidents"" — a category of mishaps that also includes hospital-acquired infections, blood clots and childbirth trauma.  Those mishaps are part of a ""silent epidemic,"" according to advocate Kathleen Finlay, founder of the Center for Patient Protection, an independent,Toronto-based group aimed at improving health care. ""People are being injured, permanently disabled and even dying … so the federal government needs to treat this as the public health-care crisis it is,"" said Finlay. And when it comes to such incidents, Finlay says the future looks grim, based on a 2017 report from the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, a not-for-profit health-care watchdog.  The report found more than 12 million Canadians in hospital and home-care settings will be harmed by the healthcare system over the next 30 years, costing the health-care system an additional $2.75 billion per year. Another 1.2 million people will lose their lives.  So what can be done? Finlay would like to see those black boxes routinely used in operating rooms across the country. She's also calling on the federal government to create an independent organization that would investigate hospital medical errors and wants Canada to implement a national hospital rating system, like those in the United States. She also wants to see provinces standardize what data is collected and reported about medical errors so Canadians have a clear picture of what's happening. ""They're very different from one province to the next,"" she says. ""So they're really not the kind of numbers that give you a full picture."" Tracy-Ann Wallace, the former patient, says she was shocked to learn how many patients have had the same — or similar — experiences to her own. In her case, the surgeon apologized, telling her it shouldn't have happened. Yet, five years later, she's still wondering how it did. ""This doesn't need to be happening and it shouldn't be happening. We need to tend to it,"" she said. St. Michael's Hospital tells Go Public it reviewed what happened in Wallace's case and the results led to changes that strengthened its process for counting equipment at the end of a procedure. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/medical-devices-left-in-patients-1.5364248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/fetal-monitor-left-inside-surgical-medical-error-1.5349111 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medical-errors-deaths-1.3565736,/news/health/fetal-monitor-left-inside-surgical-medical-error-1.5349111 /news/health/medical-errors-deaths-1.3565736
118,Shannon Flaman,2019-12-27T11:00:00.604Z,Don't pity my disability; it's not the same as being kind,"As someone with an external disability, I'd like people to know there's a line between kindness and pity. It's a realization I've come to after a lifetime of struggling with stuttering. Every single time my mouth opens, my disability is announced to the world. I've heard it all: ""spit it out,"" ""slow down,"" ""I can't understand you."" Drive-thrus are a challenge. When I talk on the phone, people think I'm cutting out. On many occasions, I've had people assume I'm drunk or disabled in other ways. These are just a few of the barriers I face every single day. I will continue to face them for the rest of my life. This is my reality. But it's not these barriers that get under my skin. I'm a smart, educated, ambitious woman, yet many people can't see past my disability. Don't get me wrong: I've never been bullied. It's actually the opposite – I'm repeatedly pitied. At least once a day, I can see pity in the eyes of someone I interact with. Take the gas attendant who's used to five-second exchanges. For me, the ""F"" in ""fill her up"" is 20 seconds and the ""R"" in ""regular"" another 20 more. I can see his expression change from confusion to panic to pity. Still, he just rolls with it, fills my tank and sends me on my way. The same can't be said for a woman who insisted on praying (quite loudly) over my head to God. She prayed pretty darn hard that God should take away my speech disability and fix my tongue. That situation was embarrassing and uncalled for. I didn't ask for her pity, nor did I ask for her prayers to ""fix"" me. Stuttering is the brain not connecting at the same pace as my tongue and lips. It also occurs because one side of my brain is stronger than the other. Do either of those sound like the end of the world? I think not. I don't pity myself and neither should you. We all have something ""wrong"" with us, whether it can be noticed by the naked eye or it's hidden inside of us. We all love to be shown kindness, but unless someone asks for pity, don't give it. Pity makes us feel less than or not enough. Over the past few years, social media has helped influence all of us to be kinder, to pay it forward. I love this movement and I think in general we are creating positive change with it. So, the next time you encounter someone different than you, rather than giving them an eye of pity, give them a big ole fist bump. The more characters and harmless differences in our cast on Earth, the better. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

The centre was more than a skating rink — it was home to countless community events and provided a real gathering place for people from Tyne Valley and beyond,"" said Socke MacDonald, territory manager for P.E.I. with Moosehead, in a written release.  The company said it hopes the pledge will help kick-start the public donation drive launched by the community to rebuild the rink.  Moosehead, based in Saint John, N.B., is the official beer sponsor of Tyne Valley's Oyster Festival and the Rock the Boat Music Festival. A dollar from every case of Moosehead beer, in six-packs or larger, sold at P.E.I. liquor stores from Jan. 20 to Feb. 29 will be donated to the Rally for the Valley campaign, to a maximum of $20,000. Eligible products are Moosehead Lager, Moosehead Light, Moosehead Pale Ale, Moosehead Premium Dry, Moosehead Radler or Alpine. ""In our own history, Moosehead has experienced devastating fires at our breweries on two occasions,"" said Moosehead president Andrew Oland in the release. ""We understand the impact of these catastrophic events and are proud to lend our support."" The Tyne Valley arena is also bidding to become the next Kraft Hockeyville. Last week, organizers with the Sackville Flyers withdrew their bid in an effort to support Tyne Valley — they said Tyne Valley needed it more.  That contest comes with the $250,000 prize to be put toward arena upgrades. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-moosehead-breweries-1.5433646,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-lower-sackville-tyne-valley-hockeyville-1.5424882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-kraft-hokceyville-jan-2020-1.5415594 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-car-fire-bypass-sunday-1.5433379 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-armed-robbery-1.5433111,/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-lower-sackville-tyne-valley-hockeyville-1.5424882 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-fire-cause-1.5425478 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-kraft-hokceyville-jan-2020-1.5415594
120,Raffy Boudjikanian,2019-12-03T00:32:26.160Z,Some Canadian schools see China's Confucius Institute as a handy teaching tool. Others reject it as propaganda,"After tying his sneaker shoelace, Laur An-Yochim jumps back to his feet.  Gym is his favourite class, and the fifth-grader does not intend to miss a moment of physical literacy consultant Stacey Hannay's instructions. ""What is this in Mandarin?"" Hannay asks, hopping around the basketball court inside Kildare School in Edmonton. The students yell the answer, then move along to a game that involves finding hidden trinkets underneath rows of plastic cups, following directions shouted in English and Mandarin.  Kildare is one of 14 schools in the Edmonton Public School Board's jurisdiction that takes part in programming offered by the Confucius Institute. That includes Mandarin classes but also other subjects taught in Mandarin, ranging from physical education to math. The Institute is partly funded by China's Ministry of Education and offers programming at elementary and high schools, as well as colleges and universities across Canada. China provides annual funding to run the programs as well as Chinese instructors who are are paid by China. In Edmonton's case, they work alongside the school's regular teachers to deliver language immersion programming. Much of Confucius Institute programming consists of classes in language and aspects of Chinese culture, such as calligraphy. China says it helps operate more than 500 of them around the world. In Canada, eight colleges and universities and three school boards have signed agreements with the organization.  Some critics, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), accuse the Institute of political interference and censorship in some of its classes, but the EPSB says it hasn't experienced those problems and has had thousands of its students complete the program since it first struck an agreement with Beijing in 2007. For An-Yochim and other students, the immersion program means his Mandarin is as smooth as his English. He switches effortlessly between the two and says knowing one of the world's most widely spoken languages has allowed him to connect with his grandparents when he visits China annually. ""They say every year, 'Wow, how are you this tall? Or, 'Your Chinese is really good this year,'"" he said.  WATCH | Students at Kildare School in Edmonton test out their Mandarin: The Edmonton school board insists it carefully reviews teaching materials and has no concerns about controversial subjects getting suppressed in class. The board receives annual funding from China to run the program, and 10 EPSB delegates flew there to renew the deal last October at Beijing's expense. ""I needed to go to see what it is, what does this look like? Right? What is the value?"" said Trisha Estabrooks, the board's chairperson and a former CBC News journalist, who was part of the delegation, there for six days. ""I learned about the value that some of our principals in Edmonton Public see in having that partnership.""  Estabrooks does not believe her independence as a trustee was compromised by having the trip expenses covered by China.   ""Taxpayer dollars were not used,"" she said.  ""I'd be concerned about the optics if Alberta taxpayer dollars were used to pay for my trip to China. I would not have gone on that trip.""  But Kathleen Lowrey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Alberta, doesn't want her nine-year-old daughter anywhere near Confucius programs. ""We're inviting them into elementary schools that Canadian taxpayers have paid for,"" she said. ""It's important to separate Chinese culture and language and civilization from the Chinese state.""  Lowrey supports student exposure to Chinese culture, but she worries the country's government ""has very different values from Canada."" She cited the example of two Canadian citizens — Fan Wei and Robert Lloyd Schellenberg — who were sentenced to death in China for drug offences. Some schools that originally took on Confucius Institute programs have since severed their ties. In 2013, McMaster University in Hamilton ended its contract with the organization after a teacher, Sonia Zhao, left the Institute, citing discriminatory hiring practices over her membership in the Falun Gong religious group. The Toronto District School Board dropped out of a partnership before it got off the ground five years ago.  At the time, Concordia and McGill universities in Montreal told CBC they were approached by China but never signed up. McGill cited a lack of safeguards to ensure its academic freedoms. New Brunswick's Education Department, meanwhile, is opting out completely by 2022, calling the program ""Chinese propaganda."" A 2013 intelligence report by CSIS warned that Chinese leaders identified Confucius as ""an organization for spreading propaganda and building soft power"" and spoke of a ""perception that CIs do not allow discussion of topics that the Chinese government deems sensitive,"" such as the political situation in Tibet and Taiwan or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.  Other foreign-government funded institutions promoting culture and education operate in Canada, including Germany's Goethe Institute, Spain's Cervantes Institute and the British Council, but CSIS placed the Confucius Institute in a different category. ""Unlike the British Council, whose charter ensures that it is free from political interference, the CIs are closely linked to the Chinese part state,"" the report said. In 2014, the director of the Confucius Institute in Quebec told CBC she was visited by CSIS agents shortly after setting up shop in Montreal, and they only left her alone after she threatened to file a human-rights complaint. Determining exactly what kind of contracts are in place between Canadian schools and the Confucius Institute can be tricky.  CBC News reached out to eight higher-education institutions to find out about their agreements with China. Four of them didn't respond: The University of Waterloo, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina and Halifax's St. Mary's University disclosed that they renewed their contracts in 2016 but only Waterloo and the Saskatchewan schools provided copies to CBC News. St. Mary's asked CBC to fill out a freedom of information request. The Coquitlam School District in British Columbia and the Edmonton Public School Board provided copies of their agreements. The two boards' contracts specify that China's role will include providing a set amount of annual funding but don't spell out an amount other than a one-time ""start-up"" contribution of $150,000 in Coquitlam's case.  If Canadian educational institutions have to accept foreign funding, they should control the curriculum, said Gordon Houlden, a former diplomat with the Canadian government who has worked in Hong Kong and Beijing. ""If there isn't enough money available, it's very hard sometimes ... to say no,"" said Houlden, who now heads the China Institute at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which is mostly funded by the province and receives no money from China. Houlden says young Canadians should continue learning about an important economic power like China, but the funding for any such education programs should come from local governments or school boards.  ""The 21st century will be, in my view, dominated by Asia,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/confucius-institute-schools-funding-1.5370858,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confucius-institute-programs-china-school-1.5259963 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-votes-to-end-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2817805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/local-chinese-school-visited-by-csis-director-says-1.2759399 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/xi-jinping-global-ambition-1.5373557 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-belt-and-road-cbc-1.5372916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-power-belt-and-road-caribbean-jamaica-1.5374967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinas-power-editors-note-1.5373823,/news/canada/new-brunswick/confucius-institute-programs-china-school-1.5259963 /news/canada/montreal/local-chinese-school-visited-by-csis-director-says-1.2759399 /news/canada/toronto/tdsb-votes-to-end-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2817805 /news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 /news/world/china-uighurs-canada-secret-documents-1.5369835
121,"Caitlin Taylor, Makda Ghebreslassie",2019-12-04T20:00:17.049Z,Plastic surgeon vows to fight potential class-action lawsuit alleging he filmed patients without consent,"UPDATE: Since the publication of this article, Dr. Martin Jugenburg has responded to CBC's request for comment. The article has been updated to reflect that response.  A Toronto plastic surgeon who could face a class-action lawsuit over allegations he breached the privacy rights of patients by recording them without their consent using surveillance cameras at his clinic said the suit is without merit and that he intends to vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Dr. Martin Jugenburg — known online as Dr. 6ix — is well-known on social media and was the focus of a Marketplace investigation last year that found security cameras in examination rooms at his clinic in the Fairmont Royal York hotel.  The petition to have the lawsuit certified as a class action was filed on behalf of former patients on Nov. 28 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. It alleges that Jugenburg failed to act in the class members' best interests and that he placed his interests over theirs ""in pursuit of his own personal and commercial gain.""  J.C., a representative plaintiff in the case, went to Jugenburg's clinic for a breast lift consultation and said the behaviour alleged in the lawsuit is unacceptable.  ""I can't imagine how many other women out there don't even know this has gone on. No doctor should be able to get away with this type of behaviour.""   The statement of claim also alleges that Jugenburg's clinic posted images of patients on social media without their consent. The allegations have not been proven in court. In a Dec. 2 statement to CBC News, Jugenburg said patient privacy continues to be his highest priority. ""We believe this legal action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit,"" he said. Jugenburg said he has apologized to his patients for not posting visible signage alerting them to the security cameras in his clinic and said the footage was ""protected, secure, and auto-deleted itself after a time delay.""  If given the go-ahead by a judge, the class-action could represent patients who visited Jugenburg's clinic, the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, between January 2012 and February 2019.   ""The heart of the lawsuit is really to get damages for women who had their trust abused by Dr. Jugenburg and who suffered some pretty serious mental health effects as a result of realizing that they were filmed without their consent,"" said Tina Yang, one of the lawyers involved in the case.  WATCH: Clinic staff says security camera in consult room is for 'the doctor's record' The plaintiffs are seeking $50 million in damages, including aggravated damages, and $25 million in punitive damages, plus an amount to be determined for special damages. Lawyers say these numbers could change if the lawsuit is certified, the number of plaintiffs in the class is determined and their additional experiences are gathered.  Last year, while reporting undercover for a story on breast implants, Marketplace producers spotted security cameras in a closed-door examination room where patients are asked to undress, as well as in the waiting area. The small black-and-white devices were attached to the ceiling in the corners of the rooms. At least some of the cameras in these rooms were also recording audio. Following CBC's coverage, Jugenburg said in an email that he provided clear signs about security cameras and removed the cameras from examination rooms.  J.C., one of two representative plaintiffs on the statement of claim, had read Marketplace's article last year.   ""I remember I was walking through my basement reading it and then I ... literally fell onto the chair and I was overcome with humiliation."" J.C. visited Jugenburg's clinic in the summer of 2018. She said a nurse asked her to remove her top and bra so that photos of her breasts could be taken for her medical record with a hand-held camera, which is common practice.  At one point, J.C. also took off her pants so the nurse could examine her for a ""tummy tuck."" J.C said that at no point during her consultation did staff tell her about the additional security cameras in the room. ""The entire time I was there, it wasn't private,"" she said. At one point during the consultation, the nurse left the room to give J.C. and her friend who accompanied her to the appointment a moment to discuss their thoughts, J.C. said. ""That private conversation for starters wasn't private,"" she alleged. ""But [the nurse] knew it wasn't private.""  Both Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) launched investigations into Jugenburg's clinic following Marketplace's reports in December 2018. The commissioner's investigation found that the clinic's use of security cameras went against Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and that the clinic did not obtain patients' consent to film them with security cameras during appointments.  The commissioner reported that the clinic had a network of 24 security cameras that were recording 24 hours a day in examination rooms, the operating room, pre-operative room, reception areas, hallways, administrative offices, a computer workroom and the staff kitchen.  According to the commissioner's report, some cameras were first installed in 2012 but stopped working sometime that year. When the clinic expanded to two floors, the system was reset. These recordings began running in January 2017. The clinic said it shut off the cameras on Dec. 13, 2018.  The footage was available for Jugenburg to view live through a secure application on his phone. Footage from the security cameras was also stored on devices that were automatically overwritten with new footage approximately every 30 days, the report said. Jugenburg told the IPC that the cameras were installed for the security of the clinic, staff and patients and not for health-care purposes.  As part of the investigation, the clinic gave the IPC examples of when footage from the surveillance cameras was reviewed by staff. On two occasions, the footage was reviewed to verify statements made by staff to patients during consultations and on another occasion to review staff conduct.  In the spring of 2019, the college told Jugenburg to remove all cameras from rooms where patients undress and required that the clinic post clear signage alerting visitors to video surveillance.  WATCH: A plaintiff says security cameras were a huge violation of her privacy The clinic told the IPC that there are now only two security cameras — one at each of the two reception desks on both floors of the clinic. These cameras are only recording after office hours.  The clinic confirmed with the IPC that it destroyed all footage recorded prior to January 2019 except for footage that was seized by the college for its investigation.  ""Even though the cameras are no longer rolling, he still has to be held accountable for what he's done,"" said J.C.  Neither of the two representative plaintiffs know if the clinic shared photos of them on social media. ""We're alleging that there were photographs taken of patients that were then placed on social media without consent,"" said Kate Mazzucco, another lawyer involved in the claim.  The lawyers who launched the lawsuit said these allegations are in the statement of claim based on a pending case against Jugenburg with the CPSO that alleges Jugenburg engaged in ""disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct"" by allowing a film crew into a patient's surgery without her consent, touching her inappropriately and posting photos of her on social media without her consent.  When asked previously about these allegations, Jugenburg said they are ""denied and being defended."" These allegations, and allegations that Jugenburg used video recording devices at his clinic, will be addressed at a college disciplinary hearing in May 2020.  If you have a story you'd like to share, send it to caitlin.taylor@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239,https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/toronto-plastic-surgeon-marketplace-cameras-1.5137052 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-breast-implant-cameras-1.4944628,[]
122,Anonymous,2020-01-19T19:00:58.466Z,Vancouver tire shop still rolling and rotating after 3 decades,"Still Standing is a series about the small businesses in the Lower Mainland that have managed to stay open despite the challenges. When Jordan Wong was a little kid, his dad Ed would take him to the East Vancouver auto shop he managed and let him ride up and down on the vehicle hoist when there were no customers around. ""I always thought that was the best thing in the world,"" Wong said. Fast-forward and a grown Wong now works at Grandview Tire & Auto Centre as a customer service advisor. His father, Ed Wong, is now his boss. The shop, located at 2886 Commercial Drive, was bought by owner John Chilton in 1985. He asked his trusted friend Ed Wong to manage the business in 1995 and 25 years later it is a trusted neighbourhood garage with many repeat customers. Those customers are helping the garage beat the odds in a city where many small businesses have not. Ed Wong compared the secret to their success to finding the right dentist, saying when people find one they trust they stick with them, even if the client doesn't really like the reason they need their services. ""It's always painful to see your dentist and it's always painful to see your auto mechanic,"" said Ed Wong. He said he has always maintained the attitude that if you treat your customers right, they'll keep coming back. A recent snowfall in Vancouver brought in a lot of those customers as they looked to buy winter tires, something Ed Wong says is needed given the city's unique snow conditions. ""People say it's a different type of snow than anywhere else in Canada and they're absolutely right,"" said Ed Wong. ""It's not the snow that gets you, it's actually the ice and slush on the ground."" He said for ice and slush, all-season tires ""won't cut it"" and winter tires, branded with a snowflake and mountain, are the ""way to go"" because they don't get snow packed up inside the tread and they provide better traction.

124,Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon,2020-01-17T22:14:28.796Z,"No way to say when damage to truck occurred, reconstructionist tells hit-and-run trial","A collision reconstructionist testified under cross-examination Friday that he has no doubt Brady Francis was struck by a vehicle because of the debris found at the fatal scene. And RCMP Cpl. Michel Lanteigne reiterated for the Moncton courtroom that the damage to the front of Maurice Johnson's pickup truck was consistent with a pedestrian being struck. But Lanteigne acknowledged he could not say whether the damage to the accused's truck occurred on Feb. 24, 2018, the night Francis was killed. The body of the 22-year-old from Elsipogtog First Nation was found on Saint-Charles South Road in Saint-Charles, about 100 kilometres north of Moncton. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles, has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. The trial is scheduled to resume on Monday morning. Defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux was set to begin his cross-examination of Lanteigne on Thursday afternoon, but requested an adjournment after learning a new witness had come forward in the nearly two-year-old case. The unnamed person contacted the RCMP, the Moncton Court of Queen's Bench heard. No other details were released at the time and the matter was not discussed in court on Friday. Lanteigne told the court his examination of Johnson's truck determined a person hit the hood, based on the damage. Lemieux asked if the damage could be consistent with an animal being struck. Lanteigne replied animals often go under a vehicle and no evidence was found underneath Johnson's truck. On Thursday, Lanteigne also told the court he found no hair from an animal on the vehicle. Earlier Friday, the court heard from Lea Ighedosa, the former owner and operator of the Saint-Charles gas bar and store the night Francis was killed. She testified she met with RCMP Const. Ricky LeBlond the afternoon after Francis was killed to review the footage from the store's security camera. A segment of the video, which was played in court, shows Francis walking eastbound on the road in front of the gas station at around 9:30 p.m. — likely the last images of him alive. Shortly after, a vehicle, possibly a pickup truck, drives by, heading in the same direction. Security video from Josée Poirier was also submitted into evidence Friday. She and her fiancé are good friends with Francis' family, she told the court. When she heard about the accident, she visited her mother and stepfather, who live on Saint-Charles South Road, to review their security camera footage. Poirier copied about three hours of video — between 9 p.m. and midnight — and gave it to police. She did not watch all of the video and she did not edit or change it in any way, she said. The trial began, which began on Monday, has heard from 24 witnesses so far. It is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.

125,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-17T12:32:48.165Z,Hustle or slow walk? Timing of new NAFTA now up to Canada,"U.S. President Donald Trump and his trade representative Robert Lighthizer called the shots many times during the renegotiation of the North American free trade agreement. But one final question is completely out of the Americans' hands: how soon will Canada ratify? ""All eyes will be on Canada to get the job done quickly so we can all work together to implement this agreement,"" Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley said Wednesday as the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) reached the floor for debate. On Thursday, American senators voted 89-10 to send the deal over to the White House for signing, setting up Trump for a congratulatory photo op in the Oval Office as early as next week — when he may be all too happy to have something to distract from that other thing on Washington's agenda. But the deal won't kick in until 90 days after all three countries complete their ratification processes. Things are good to go in Mexico, the drama in Washington appears over and — because Canada pledged to move in ""lockstep"" with the U.S. — some people have speculated that the deal could come into force as early as May 2020. But is Ottawa in a mood to rush? There are a few things to consider before making any time-sensitive business decisions based on the revised deal taking effect. The most important thing to understand is that there is no actual ""ratification vote"" in Canada's Parliament. The federal executive (cabinet) ratifies international treaties once laws and regulations are changed to bring the country into compliance. Changing the laws and regulations required for the new NAFTA (or NAFTA 2.1, taking into account the rewrites Congressional Democrats insisted on that became the protocol of amendment signed in Mexico City last month) means passing implementation legislation. Canada had legislation in the works for the trade pact when the last Parliament was dissolved for the election. Because the bulk of the deal has not changed, Canada's drafters are not starting from scratch. As we saw in the last Parliament, a ways and means motion may come first, because there's a taxation change in this deal: the new (and unprecedented) export caps being imposed on Canada's dairy sector will be enforced with high tariffs. The protocol of amendment doesn't require substantial revisions of Canada's implementation bill, but fixing the state-to-state dispute resolution system, for example, could require new language. Parliament returns from its holiday break in ten days, on Jan. 27. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who retained responsibility for NAFTA in last fall's cabinet shuffle, tabled the protocol of amendment on Dec. 12, before the House rose. That date may matter. Or it may not. The Government of Canada's policy for international trade treaties like this one normally requires that a treaty be tabled for 21 sitting days before the House proceeds with implementation legislation. The Commons observed this waiting period a year ago, for the first version of the implementing bill. But is it required to do so again? Questions from CBC News have not yet yielded a clear answer. If this waiting period is observed, that means no legislation until mid-March. If the government skips the waiting period (and it has been waived for other deals), the House could get down to debate in late January. Two days' notice must be given before anything's introduced, so keen observers will be watching the notice paper until then. Once legislation is introduced, several factors may determine how fast it moves. At the risk of anticipating how MPs will vote (never a safe thing to do), here's what could unfold: Conservatives appear likely to offer a vigorous critique before eventually voting in favour of the new NAFTA, citing the overall national interest as they opt not to get in the deal's way. But objections raised by the Bloc Québécois and the NDP before the holidays seemed to suggest this bill would not have the support of the other two parties. Expediting legislation usually requires one of two things: all-party support, or strong-arm tactics like time allocation votes or closure to ram the bill through at various stages. Would Opposition MPs vote in favour of time allocation in a minority Parliament? Then there's the requirement that implementing legislation be reviewed by at least one committee — a committee which will no longer effectively be controlled by a majority of Liberal MPs. Will committee members undertake a long study, or a concise one? Will Senate committees choose to meet concurrently, as they have on time-sensitive legislation in the past? Finally, there's the Senate, which will be under new leadership (we don't yet know whose). When the implementation bill is sent over, will senators pass it swiftly? Or will the Senate exercise its right to oversee a thorough kicking of the tires — even if that takes months, not days? Moving anything through a minority Parliament takes strategy and negotiation. Moving quickly on a deal that's not universally loved was always going to be a challenge. And in the aftermath of the events of the past week in Canada–U.S. relations, the public's mood may not motivate the Trudeau government — which is clearly focused on other things at the moment — to spend much political capital on hustling to please the Americans.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-ratification-canada-friday-1.5429181,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/usmca-senate-passes-1.5429451 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/house-passes-new-nafta-1.5403272 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/what-nafta-changes-mean-for-canada-1.5391803,/news/politics/usmca-senate-passes-1.5429451 /news/politics/trudeau-china-trump-ambrose-trade-nato-1.5403293 /news/politics/house-passes-new-nafta-1.5403272 /news/politics/justin-trudeau-chrystia-freeland-mandate-1.5395513 /news/business/china-trade-tariffs-united-states-trump-1.5395670 /news/business/fed-economy-future-1.5391444 /news/politics/what-nafta-changes-mean-for-canada-1.5391803 /news/politics/nafta-cusma-usmca-trade-freeland-pelosi-trump-1.5390452
126,Erica Johnson,2019-09-30T00:00:00.921Z,"Toronto-area man out $2,775 after e-transfer fraudsters impersonate him on email","A Toronto-area contractor says it was ""pretty creepy"" to discover someone had hacked into his email and impersonated him — convincing customers of his family-owned granite countertop business to send thousands of dollars via e-transfer.  The fraudsters then stole the payments. ""You can't think of something like this happening,"" said Sarmen Sinani, of Markham, Ont. ""They [fraudsters] were saying, 'Send me the money. And don't send a cheque. Just e-transfer it.'"" Sinani is one of more than 200 people Go Public has learned were recently targeted by fraudsters who stole tens of thousands of dollars, sent via Interac e-transfers, by breaking into email accounts and redirecting the money.  Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact our Go Public team It has some experts questioning why the popular electronic money transfer system involves email at all, when other jurisdictions have stronger security.  ""Canadian customers deserve the best safety and security for their banking and e-transactions,"" said cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa, who advises governments and companies. ""Unfortunately, we are far from getting there."" Sinani was working on a customer's order when he emailed her in March, asking for a 50 per cent deposit. By May, he still hadn't received it, so he asked again.  To his surprise, his client said she had e-transferred it on March 15. Sinani searched through deleted emails and discovered a fraudster had impersonated him and told his client to e-transfer $2,775. ""The hacker would alter my conversation to them [his customer] and alter their conversation to me,"" said Sinani. ""Basically they were taking full control of two people, just going back and forth. It's unbelievable."" Posing as Sinani, the fraudster told his client he had an out-of-town family emergency and instructed her not to stop by the store to drop off a cheque.  Instead, the fraudster told her to send an e-transfer to a new email that appeared similar to the actual email for Sinani's family business, Sinco Marble and Granite. Then, the fraudster posed as Sinani's client and altered her emails, telling Sinani that she was dealing with a family emergency and couldn't come to the shop to pay the deposit. ""It was insane,"" said Sinani. ""They played us good."" Sinani says when his customer contacted Interac, the company said its e-transfer system had worked — moving money from point A to point B — and that it was not going to investigate. ""They're just not being co-operative,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's an easy way to see where the money went. But no one wants to work on it, I guess."" Interac declined an interview request with Go Public, but in a statement said each fraud case is ""unique and customers should speak to their bank directly."" Interac would not address Sinani's — or other customers' — concerns. Interac is a private company and Canada's big banks and credit unions are among its shareholders. Sinani's customer lost the money through her account at CIBC. The bank would not tell Go Public what — if anything — it was doing to help trace the money, but in a statement said funds sent ""to an email impersonator are very difficult to recover."" York Regional Police are investigating.  A cybercrime expert who specializes in password cracking says many people aren't aware of the underground community of fraudsters who buy and share email and password information, aimed at draining bank accounts. ""There's people doing offensive research to determine new ways of attacking,"" security systems, said Dustin Heywood, with IBM's X-Force Red.  ""It's turning into an arms race."" Heywood estimates that the average person uses their email and password on about 300 sites — from the local library to pizza delivery — and any one of those databases can get hacked. ""The problem is, not every site has the same level of security around their passwords,"" he said. ""So if a weaker site gets hacked, then all of a sudden your password is being leaked out."" Heywood says hackers then use bots — custom software — that can lurk undetected on hundreds of thousands of computers. ""They could have something sitting there for months and when the right keywords come through"" — such as ""payment"" or ""deposit"" and — ""Bang! We've got ourselves a transfer."" So Interac's e-transfer system, he says, is only as secure as users' email and passwords. On the heels of a Go Public story published last week about e-transfers, we heard from a number of people who have lived in other countries that use systems that allow people to electronically transfer funds directly from bank to bank. ""One does not have to worry about payments being intercepted,"" Andrew Dunning wrote, about e-transfers in the U.K.  ""Everything is practically instantaneous, and it's all traced between the banks. It's shocking to me that the [Canadian] government has not mandated the implementation of this system."" Rajesh Vijayaraghavan, who studies risk management in financial institutions, says Interac's system is ""unique"" because it relies on email, unlike most in other developed countries. Vijayaraghavan, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, says the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries have had systems in place for years that allow e-transfers directly from bank to bank — using only a bank code and a person's account number.  ""The rest of the world can't be wrong,"" he said. ""It's the better system."" Two weeks ago, the European Union went a step further, requiring all financial institutions to offer two-factor authentication — a system which only allows a user to log on to an account once they've received a code on a separate device or an email at a different email address. Vijayaraghavan says shifting away from an email-reliant system would require work. ""It's a legacy system,"" he said. ""So this has to be a co-ordinated effort from all banks."" Popa, the cybersecurity expert, says the only way banks will improve security for e-transfers — and the auto-deposit option — is if the government forces them.  He says requirements for strong authentication are needed immediately, instead of the convenient, but less secure, system currently in place. ""No more secrecy and downplaying these issues,"" Popa said. ""Canadians need to demand reform from their politicians."" Sinani the contractor, says he's no longer a fan of e-transfers, since he and his customer are now in a ""stressful"" dispute over who should cover the stolen $2,775.  But he says about 80 per cent of his customers want to pay using e-transfer because it's so convenient. ""Convenient is great, until something like this happens to you,"" he said. ""Improving the system would be better.""

""Education is affected, lifestyle is affected. You need enough housing, you need enough space for everybody."" The men's transitional shelter will occupy a three-bedroom house donated by the N.W.T. Housing Corporation. Tobac said Service Canada provided initial funding, some of which will be used to pay a manager who's been hired from outside the community. There should be room for three or four clients, to start.  The shelter will provide more than just a place to live.  Prospective residents must be 19 years old, willing to achieve sobriety and be ""willing to work consistently with the shelter manager to develop and maintain a personal plan for setting short-term and long-term goals and strategies,"" the poster reads. ""It is geared towards moving people to wellness and to healthy lifestyles,"" said Tobac. ""And then transitioning them to owning homes further down the line."" Tobac, whose day job is with Ne'Rahten Developments Ltd., the business arm of the Yamoga Land Corporation, says he got involved in the project partly because the housing crisis was so bad that people were asking to rent homes reserved for corporate staff housing.  A survey conducted by the society in 2017 found 50 of the 500 people who live in the community were homeless. ""The studies that we looked at all indicated that without a home, without a place to live or adequate housing, the social side of things begins to build up,"" said Tobac. ""The use of alcohol or drugs, overcrowding … disagreements, anger.""  The society still hopes to work toward opening a women's or family shelter, Tobac said. ""We needed something to start off with. We needed a program that would actually work with the community, do something with homelessness, trying to incorporate wellness and trying to give some hope to people that are in the system that are probably waiting for something to happen.""  Application forms are available at the RCMP detachment, Roman Catholic mission, health centre, and the local housing authority, or from community elder Florence Barnaby.  The N.W.T. Housing Corporation did not respond to an interview request for this story.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fort-good-hope-transitional-shelter-1.5432212,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fort-good-hope-housing-crisis-next-steps-1.5042791 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fort-good-hope-shelter-1.4544413,/news/canada/north/housing-crisis-nwt-minister-1.5395131 /news/canada/north/hay-river-mens-emergency-shelter-dire-need-1.5410488 /news/canada/north/nwthc-annual-report-2018-1.5417036 /news/canada/north/fort-good-hope-housing-1.4434760
128,Josh Dubow,2020-01-20T04:35:11.776Z,49ers ship off Packers in lopsided affair to secure Super Bowl showdown with Chiefs,"From No. 2 pick in the draft to one of the last two teams standing. It has been a remarkable turnaround for the Super Bowl-bound San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers (15-3) advanced to their first Super Bowl in seven years and will play the Kansas City Chiefs in two weeks in Miami for the championship. ""Our team, it's incredible to be a part of,"" Garoppolo said. ""We can win so many different ways. Raheem, those guys up front, the tight ends obviously were just dominating tonight. It was fun."" The Niners won just 10 games in the first two seasons under coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch, going 4-12 last season after Garoppolo went down with a season-ending knee injury in Week 3. Now, San Francisco is one of two teams remaining after delivering a second thorough beating of the season to Rodgers and the Packers (14-4). The 49ers are the third team to make it to the Super Bowl a year after winning four or fewer games, joining Cincinnati (1988) and the Rams (1999). Bosa, the prize for last year's rough season as the No. 2 overall pick, helped set the tone when he ended Green Bay's second drive of the game with a 13-yard sack of Rodgers. Mostert, a former special teams standout, did much of the rest in a remarkable redemption story for a former surfer who was cut seven times and carried the ball only eight times in his first three seasons in the NFL. But he has become a key part of the NFC's top team this year, leading the Niners with 772 yards rushing in the regular season and delivering a performance for the ages in the NFC title game. He had the second-most yards rushing in a playoff game to Eric Dickerson's 248 for the Rams on Jan. 4, 1986, and was the first player to rush for at least four TDs and 200 yards in a playoff game. ""You know, honestly, I just woke up like it was any other game,"" Mostert said. ""It was one of those things where hey, once we all get in a groove, we're just going to keep it riding, keep it going and that's what we did."" He got started when he burst 36 yards on a third-and-8 trap play to open the scoring on San Francisco's second drive and kept ripping off long runs behind impressive blocking. He added TD runs of nine and 18 yards in the second quarter and had 160 yards rushing at the half, becoming the only player in NFL history to rush for at least 150 yards and three TDs in the first half of a playoff game. Mostert added a 22-yard TD run in the third quarter. ""It was working,"" Shanahan said of the run-heavy approach. ""If it's working, you stay with it. Our guys are running so hard, our O-line coming off the ball, our backs, all 11 of our guys, as they've been all year. The guys fought hard as heck, we were going to put it all in their hands."" Rodgers and the Packers were unable to match that performance as they got overwhelmed by San Francisco's dominant front for a second time this season. He lost a snap from centre to end Green Bay's only promising drive of the half, threw an interception to Emmanuel Moseley late in the half and didn't convert his first third down of the season against the Niners until connecting on a 6-yard pass to Aaron Jones on the opening drive of the second quarter for his first third-down conversion in 18 attempts this season against the Niners. Rodgers capped that drive with a nine-yard TD pass to Jones, but the game was too far out of hand by that point. He led Green Bay to two more TDs and finished with 326 yards passing, but it wasn't nearly enough as the Packers lost the NFC title game for the third time since their last Super Bowl trip following the 2010 season.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/nfl/packers-niners-nfl-playoffs-conference-nfc-finals-jan-19-1.5432743,https://stats.cbc.ca/football/nfl/boxscore/80737 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/nfl/chiefs-titans-nfl-playoffs-conference-afc-finals-jan-19-1.5432731,https://stats.cbc.ca/football/nfl/boxscore/80737 /sports/football/nfl/chiefs-titans-nfl-playoffs-conference-afc-finals-jan-19-1.5432731 /sports/football/nfl/nfl-playoffs-texans-chiefs-1.5424305 /sports/football/nfl/nfl-divisional-playoffs-tennessee-titans-baltimore-ravens-1.5423991 https://stats.cbc.ca/football/nfl/team/17 https://stats.cbc.ca/football/nfl/team/5

These arts stand to be lost in the age of mass production and planned obsolescence. Photos taken on film are meant to last but when they're forgotten about and sit undeveloped, especially for a long period of time, it gets trickier to recover those memories.  That's where Greg Miller, of Film Rescue International in Indian Head, Sask., steps in. ""It's great work. We've never got rich doing this work, but we've always been highly entertained,"" Miller said.  The stories customers tell him tend to be similar: a family member died, then they go through their belongings and old rolls of undeveloped film are discovered. Sometimes, the photos are ""a bit naughty"" or sexually explicit, but Miller said, for the most part, family members are excited to see them and rarely ask for those to be withheld in their final package of images. He noted the company is intensely private the images they process,  so they can't accidentally be leaked. Because regular film processing labs, which are increasingly rare, don't always have the right chemicals or materials to process those rolls of undeveloped film, this business 70 kilometres east of Regina, fills that niche.  When he started the business in 1999, Miller would get two or three phone calls a week from prospective customers.  That changed when he was put on Kodak's referral list; he then started to receive 20 to 30 calls a day. Miller said the company has worked with film dating as far back as the 1920s, and has done work with various law enforcement agencies, two presidential libraries, the Smithsonian Institution and for customers from around the world. ""It's opening time capsules for a living, basically,"" Miller said.  ""That's fun work. To this day, I love the job. I like getting up in the morning and seeing what we'll discover."" In particular, Miller said he enjoys working with old, high-quality photo negatives. He said they're similar to antiques, and he likes seeing how careful people were about taking photographs because they were expensive and more difficult to make. Miller said the company is working to future-proof his business. The company is relaunching its website soon, and it will be shining a light on the business's film scanning and archive digitization services as well as their film recovery work.  He said it's not always the most exciting work, but it's work that will keep the business alive as there becomes less and less old film to process.  ""We're always trying to innovate and do that type of work better than other people,"" Miller said.  Read other pieces from the Made to Last series:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-photo-film-recovery-digitization-1.5429355,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-luthier-1.5423298 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-bookbinding-1.5403310 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-venice-tailors-1.5402224 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-franks-shoe-repair-1.5403245,[]

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said more than 900 villagers who fell ill have been treated, mostly for exposure to volcanic ash, in evacuation sites since the volcano began erupting in Batangas province near Manila, the capital, last weekend. About 125,000 people fled from ash-blanketed villages and crammed into hundreds of emergency centres in Batangas alone and many others took shelter in relatives' homes, disaster-response officials said, appealing for masks, bottled water, portable toilets, food and sleeping mats. ""It's really massive because you're talking of more or less 100,000 evacuees in evacuation centres, so the infrastructure and services needed are really huge,"" Duque said. ""This is not going to be for the short term, but for the medium if not long term."" After belching a massive plume of ash and steam more than 15 kilometres into the sky when it rumbled back to life last Sunday, Taal has been spewing smaller emissions and shuddering with fewer earthquakes in recent days. But despite a perceived waning of its restiveness, continuing volcanic quakes, the drying of Taal's crater lake and other signs indicate magma is moving beneath, said Renato Solidum, who heads the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. ""We have this perception now that it's waning versus underground sub-surface activity, which indicates otherwise,"" Solidum said at a news conference, adding that experts ""have not seen a definite trend that it's weakening."" The 311-metre-high Taal is one of the world's smallest but the second-most restive of about two dozen active Philippine volcanoes. It has remained at alert level 4, the second-highest warning, indicating a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours or days. Duque said hundreds of villagers have been treated for respiratory infections, hypertension, diarrhea, skin lesions, flu and coughs in evacuation centres. About 300,000 masks, including those from regions unaffected by the volcanic eruption, have been sent to calamity-hit areas. The government's main disaster-response agency will hold a meeting next week to discuss concerns, including hygiene in evacuation camps, Duque said. He has sought the help of the military to build latrines and repair toilets in emergency shelters, mostly school buildings. In the hard-hit town of Agoncillo, Mayor Daniel Reyes said all 42,000 residents abandoned their homes, including 8,000 who are now encamped in evacuation centres and need food, water and aid. ""They rushed out of their homes without bringing anything, so they will really be dependent on our help,"" Reyes said. Agoncillo still has about two weeks worth of food, water and aid packs and will need help from the provincial and national governments when supplies get depleted, he said. While tending to the thousands of displaced residents, Reyes said he and other officials were preparing contingency plans in case Taal erupts violently. ""There is a great possibility that it will erupt,"" Reyes said, citing a briefing by government volcano experts. The Philippines lies along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" a string of faults around the ocean basin where many of the world's earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/taal-volcano-philippines-1.5432093,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/volcano-philippines-evacuations-taal-1.5429720 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/local-filipinos-fundraising-for-taal-volcano-victims-1.5428444,[]
131,Michael Gorman,2020-01-20T10:00:00.592Z,Province reviewing policy for children requiring emergency placements,"Nova Scotia's Department of Community Services is reviewing its policy for young people in the care of the province who require emergency housing in hotels and other settings after numbers skyrocketed in the last three years. Considered a last resort, places of safety are only supposed to be used when there is no other appropriate spot available for a young person requiring the province's care, and they're only intended to be used for a short period of time. But in the last three years, the number of people staying in places of safety, and the amount of time some of them are there before being moved to another option, has gone up exponentially. The thousands of hours in hotels, houses, apartments or cottages around the province have come at a cost of nearly $30 million, with some young people spending multiple years in the settings. Wendy Bungay, the director of placement services for the Community Services Department, said it was clear the policy needed to be reviewed because it was only ever intended for young people to be in places of safety for up to 28 days. Bungay said the department wanted to make sure service providers had a clear understanding of what is required in certain situations. The department contracts the work to four companies. Talk of the review started in meetings last April with service providers to discuss the process and review how vetting of staff is done and reported to the department. The second part of the review focuses on expectations for providers in short-term, urgent-care settings. The final step, which will happen in the coming months, will focus on requirements for staff in arrangements that exceed 90 days. ""It may be the exact same staff, but the expectation around the training process or the number of staff that are interacting with the child [could change],"" said Bungay. The review process wasn't prompted by any specific concerns or problems with the services children were receiving in places of safety, said Bungay, but rather ensuring what's happening meets the current need. There are people who do have concerns about the system. Alec Stratford, executive director and registrar of the Nova Scotia College of Social Workers, said the fact the numbers have gone up so much is an indication of a problem. Stratford said the department has been too slow to react to increases in complexity of cases. ""This has to go back with how we have consistently underfunded social services in our province,"" he said. Stratford and others have particular concerns about the people staffing places of safety, noting there is no formal regulation the way there is in group homes or foster homes. It's vital that people staffing places of safety are trained and regulated in a meaningful way, said Stratford. ""We need to have a clear competency profile of who's going to be operating them, we need to have clear regulations."" Debra Reimer, executive director for the Kids Action Program, is not only concerned about the vetting process, she also has big concerns about the costs. Tens of thousands of dollars are spent per month on each child in a place of safety. Reimer believes in many cases it's money that could be better directed in a way that would keep the use of places of safety to a minimum. ""Can you even begin to imagine how much therapy you could get, or whatever you could get, for $40,000?"" Bungay said there are plans to shift to a more preventative approach, something that's started with pilot projects, but it doesn't change the fact that going onto a waiting list is not an option for young people coming into the province's care. That means they have to go somewhere, and right now places of safety are the backstop when no other option is available. As of Friday, there were 45 children in places of safety. For Stratford, that's part of the problem. He remembers a time when it would be just a handful of people at a time who required the placements. Stratford compared the situation to food bank use. ""Food banks were meant to be a temporary emergency measure for folks to have food security,"" he said, noting that is no longer the case. ""We do not want places of safety to reach that same standpoint."" Despite the concerns, Bungay said the department believes service providers are aware of expectations. Because social workers have regular contact with the kids in places of safety and their workers, Bungay said any issues would be identified and addressed.

133,Maryse Zeidler,2020-01-19T13:00:00.887Z,Bulldog breeder ordered to give refund after complaints about puppy's behaviour,"An Alberta dog breeder is out $2,685 after the B.C. buyer of one of her bulldogs complained about the puppy's behaviour.  The B.C. Civil Resolution Tribunal recently ruled that dog breeder Michelle Graham, operator of Peace Bulldogs, refund customer Dawn Dzenkiw the $2,500 she paid for the eight-month-old bulldog, plus interest and tribunal fees.  Dzenkiw told the tribunal the puppy seemed to be adapting well after she got the animal in June 2018, but by August it didn't like being on a leash and was baring its teeth and soiling itself.  Graham argued that she didn't compensate Dzenkiw with another animal because she was concerned about the puppy's weight and behaviour when Dzenkiw returned it. The tribunal member disagreed with that assessment.  Animal rights lawyer Rebeka Breder says it's highly unusual for dog breeders to refund customers because of an animal's temperament.  ""Behavioural issues are common in any animal,"" Breder said. ""The decision didn't talk about the applicant trying to take the dog for formal training."" But Breder also warns that it can be difficult for those who buy a dog from a breeder to know about any previous issues with that person's animals.  ""This case also speaks to a bigger problem about how there is a lack of regulation for breeders anywhere in the country,"" she said.  According to the decision, two months after Dzenkiw received the eight-month-old bulldog she texted the owner to say the dog didn't like being on a leash and was uncomfortable around her son. She also said the dog was baring its teeth, was afraid to go out in public, and was so scared of people that it would soil itself.  The decision says Graham was initially supportive, and told Dzenkiw she would take the dog back. Dzenkiw asked about compensation, but Graham said she couldn't make any promises until she checked the dog's health.  The contract said refunds don't apply to temperament, but also that the breeder should be given the option of taking the dog back if the owner couldn't keep the animal for any reason — but with no mention of compensation if that were the case, according to the decision.  Dzenkiw returned the dog in October 2018, four months after taking it home. Graham initially sent videos of the dog, but the decision says she then began to claim that the puppy was severely underweight.  However, the tribunal member says this wasn't evident in the photos and video that Graham submitted as evidence.  Graham initially told Dzenkiw she would provide her with a new puppy or a hairless sphynx cat, which Graham also breeds. The tribunal said this put into question the breeder's concerns about her customer's ability to care for a pet.  For months, Dzenkiw and Graham exchanged messages about travel arrangements, with no new pet in sight.  The decision says although the contract specified that refunds didn't cover temperament, the breeder did promise Dzenkiw a new puppy or cat.  Also, the tribunal didn't accept Graham's explanation about her concerns for the dog.  Based on that evidence, the tribunal ruled that Graham should reimburse Dzenkiw for the amount she paid for the bulldog, plus interest and tribunal fees.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bulldog-breeder-refund-1.5431868,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-order-in-council-to-protect-cats-and-dogs-1.3551099 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/therapy-dog-taken-1.3876116 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/rescued-dogs-from-langley-breeder-start-rehabilitation-1.3443778 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/lola-charley-1.5273073,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/summer-winter-m-s-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-tires-when-it-snows-1.5432005 /news/canada/british-columbia/contentious-jumbo-valley-to-become-indigenous-protected-area-with-21m-fund-1.5431665 /news/canada/british-columbia/sechelt-residents-angered-by-logging-activity-on-neighbouring-property-1.5430029
134,Stephanie Tobin,2020-01-17T17:24:47.432Z,John Crosbie remembered by MP as champion of equal rights,"John Crosbie left behind a long and storied legacy, but it goes beyond his economic accomplishments, says Liberal MP Seamus O'Regan. While he was a long-standing member of the Progressive Conservatives, Crosbie held firm to Red Tory beliefs. In 1990, Crosbie fought for the reinstatement of funding that had been cut for women's programs across Canada, as well as protecting LGBT people from discrimination. O'Regan knew Crosbie for most of his life and said while the man was a political icon, he was also a ""champion"" for equal rights, even when it was unpopular with his own party. ""He made amendments to the human rights code to make sure that there was no discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civil service, the military, the RCMP,"" O'Regan said. ""It was a move that was so controversial at the time … within his own party. And he had to take it to the floor of the House of Commons."" O'Regan said that, in itself, is an accomplishment to be proud of. ""When you come to his funeral with your husband, you don't forget that."" As the federal minister for natural resources, O'Regan said it's a daunting role to fill, knowing it's a department established in large part thanks to Crosbie's work through his years in Ottawa. In particular, the signing of a renewed Atlantic Accord last year highlighted for O'Regan the extent of the work Crosbie put into ensuring Newfoundland and Labrador's economic prosperity. ""When you get into how intricate that deal was, you realize the political capital he expended, you realize how savvy he was to get that for us politically,"" O'Regan said. ""It was an extraordinary feat. That document, the Atlantic Accord, is our document of prosperity in this province. If he is remembered singularly for anything in this province, I think it's that."" But, as many who knew Crosbie will attest, there are a great many other things he will be remembered for. O'Regan said he will remember Crosbie's humour — his ""poetic profanity"" — as well as being a man dedicated to his home province. ""Look at the years of public service that he put in for this province and for the people of this province,"" O'Regan said. ""[He was] a man, I think, of such intelligence and such empathy and a man who showed you can be every bit as patriotic to your province without it taking away from being patriotic to your country.""

136,Sara Minogue,2020-01-20T14:00:00.843Z,Public hearings into $1B Giant Mine remediation begin at last,"Public hearings on the closure and remediation plan for Yellowknife's defunct Giant Mine begin Monday.  That's after 13 years of study, planning, assessment and discussion. ""It's monumental,"" said Natalie Plato, deputy director of the Giant Mine Remediation Project, which is leading the cleanup. The project is seeking a water licence for a 20-year term and a land-use permit for a five-year term from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. If all goes well, Plato anticipates her group could have those permits — along with terms and conditions — as soon as this summer, and start work on the cleanup project in 2020/2021. ""It means we can actually start the work and get this site remediated,"" Plato said. The Giant Mine site, which sits within the boundaries of the City of Yellowknife, is one of the most contaminated sites in Canada. From 1948 until 2004, gold from Giant Mine was a major economic driver for Yellowknife and the N.W.T. The mine became the property of the government of Canada in 1999, when Royal Oak Mines Inc. went into receivership. It operated for another five years before closing for good.  The closure and remediation plan first and foremost addresses 237,000 tonnes of highly toxic arsenic trioxide left behind. The plan is to freeze the waste underground forever using thermosyphon technology. The cleanup will also fill old pits, cover up tailings ponds and build a new water treatment plant so that runoff water can be treated before being discharged. It will also see the cleanup of the former Giant Mine townsite, on the shore of Back Bay, as well as the future site of a mining heritage museum.  ""Our pitch is to make the site safer for the environment and the public,"" said Plato.  In 2007, when the plan was first presented and before an environmental assessment was ordered, it came with a price tag of $947 million, which was frequently rounded up to $1 billion. Plato said she expects that number to be revised once the terms and conditions of the water licence are made clear.  Most of the details of the cleanup plan have already been reviewed by stakeholders and discussed at length during two technical sessions and a ""closure criteria"" workshop.  Stakeholders — from the Yellowknives Dene First Nation to Fisheries and Oceans Canada — have already filed their evidence, all of which is available on the land and water board's public registry.  ""There has been a lot of work done up until this point,"" said Shelagh Montgomery, executive director of the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. The enormous project is not without controversy.  ""While we support the overall goals of the Project, in its current form, the water licence process is not capable of accommodating the YKDFN's rights,"" reads the opening slide of a presentation from the Yellowknives Dene First Nation.  The First Nation is still seeking compensation and an apology for the damage caused by the mine. It also fears that Baker Creek, which runs through the site, will not be returned to its full health, and that the Yellowknives will be shut out of environmental monitoring to follow the remediation unless more is done to train and build capacity among First Nation members. The City of Yellowknife also has concerns.  ""The project's responses to the City's outstanding concerns have mostly refused to acknowledge validity of the concerns and a consequential absence of effort in addressing them,"" reads a slide the city will present this week. ""Rather than working to resolve the issue, the project's effort has been in denying their applicability or value."" City administrator Sheila Bassi-Kellett is most concerned with the socio-economic impact of the cleanup. In particular, maximizing the business and employment opportunities for Yellowknifers and the Yellowknives Dene.  ""This is a complex project,"" she said. ""There are opportunities associated with the remediation and those benefits should accrue here given the legacy of the project for the region."" Bassi-Kellett notes that the mine site takes up about seven per cent of the land within the city's municipal boundary, presenting unique opportunities. ""It's not like it's 350 miles away.""  But no matter what happens, Bassi-Kellett said this week's hearings are significant.  ""This is huge,"" said Bassi-Kellett. ""If there is an opportunity now — which we believe there is — to find some good to come out of the mine, we really want to see that happen."" The hearings will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday in the Caribou Room at the Chateau Nova hotel, most of it taken up by registered interveners. Evening sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday are reserved for public comments and questions (though the public is invited to attend all sessions).

The Shaw Group has sold a 153-hectare parcel of land to the Halifax Regional Municipality on the stipulation that it be used for a wilderness park and not a residential development. ""This is land that has been largely untouched,"" said Shaw Group chair Allan Shaw. ""If any structure was ever built on it, it would have been on the perimeter, if at all, and there have been some trails through there since I was a child."" Shaw said the idea behind the Shaw Wilderness Park, which is twice the size of Point Pleasant Park, was first floated four years ago. The Nature Conservancy of Canada, a land conservation organization, is also part of the partnership between the city and the Shaw Group. The city paid $6.6 million to purchase the land, while roughly $1.4 million is being spent on things such as legal, appraisal and survey fees, as well as a long-term management fund. The total funds come from: ""The Shaw Wilderness Park is a rugged and exceptional example of the abundant nature and wild spaces we are so fortunate to have right at our doorstep here in Halifax,"" said Craig Smith, Nova Scotia program director for the Nature Conservancy of Canada. The Shaw Wilderness Park will protect native habitat for many bird species and other wildlife. Some rough trails are already in place where hikers enjoy the lakes and glacier-created rocky barrens, all a short drive from downtown Halifax. ""A city like Halifax and the province of Nova Scotia needs to retain people here and bring in people,"" said Shaw.

The Municipality of the County of Antigonish has been calling on the province to make immediate changes to the area where Highway 4 and Beech Hill Road meet. An emergency meeting was held on Dec. 9 to discuss the matter after a man from Toronto was killed in December in a three-vehicle crash involving a logging truck at the intersection. Three people were injured in another crash at the same intersection the day before the meeting. ""The number of incidents and the frequency was starting to concern us as it was heading into the winter season again,"" said Owen McCarron, warden for the municipality. ""We just felt something had to be done. ""The opportunity for a major accident was always in the back of our minds."" McCarron said the local fire department reported to the municipality that 22 per cent of their total calls in the last 2½ years involved the intersection. Marla MacInnis, spokesperson for the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal, said a decision was made to close Trunk 4 from South River Road to Beech Hill Road until permanent upgrades have been made. MacInnis said a roundabout will be constructed. ""Our Highway Improvement Plan has construction of the roundabout scheduled for the 2021/22 construction season,"" she said. ""However, we have begun design and planning work for the intersection in hopes there is an opportunity to begin construction in the 2020/2021 construction season."" A detour is available through South River Road and Beech Hill Road, which McCarron said takes about 1.5 km more than it normally would. The intersection itself has gone from four-way traffic to a three-way stop. ""You could still have a fender-bender there, but it wouldn't be a high-speed collision that someone doing 80 kilometres an hour and someone getting T-boned,"" McCarron said. ""So that at least has remedied that part."" McCarron said people involved in some of the accidents, first responders and the general public were invited to speak at the meeting in December. ""People told us that evening they avoided that intersection and that section of highway almost all the time,"" he said, adding that a man involved in the fatal accident spoke as well. ""He said there was just a loud noise and all of a sudden everything went completely silent. And he said he thought for a second, 'Am I dead?',"" McCarron said. ""It was a bit of an eye-opener."" McCarron said there are some businesses that may be impacted by the detour, but that safety has to be the top priority. The area is expected to remain closed until the roundabout is completed.

139,Kris Rowe,2019-12-27T09:00:00.675Z,The race to exascale is on — while Canada watches from the sidelines,"This column is an opinion by Kris Rowe, a computational scientist working to get science and engineering applications ready for the next generation of exascale supercomputers. Born and educated in Canada, he has worked at major Canadian and American Universities, as well as two U.S. national laboratories. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Some of the brightest minds from around the globe have been quietly working on technology that promises to turn the world on its head, but so far Canada has been watching from the sidelines. While it is unlikely that people will be huddled around their televisions to watch the power to these incredible machines being switched on, the scientific discoveries that follow the debut of exascale computers will change our daily lives in unimaginable ways. So what exactly is an exascale computer? It's a supercomputer capable of performing more than a billion billion calculations per second — or 1 exaflops. ""Exa"" is the metric system prefix for such grandiose numbers, and ""flops"" is an abbreviation of ""floating-point operations per second."" For comparison, my laptop computer is capable of about 124 gigaflops, or 124 billion calculations per second, which sounds fast. According to the TOP500 list, today's fastest supercomputer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit, which tops out at a measured 148.6 petaflops — about one million times faster than my laptop. However, Summit is a mere welterweight relative to an exascale supercomputer, which is more than 60 times faster. To put that speed in perspective, if you took all the calculations a modern laptop can perform in a single second, and instead did the arithmetic non-stop with pencil and paper at a rate of one calculation per second, it would take roughly 3,932 years to finish. In a single second, a supercomputer capable of 1 exaflops could do a series of calculations that would take about 31.7 billion years by hand. While colloquially a supercomputer is referred to as a single entity, it is actually composed of thousands of servers — or compute nodes — connected by a dedicated high-speed network. You might assume that an exascale supercomputer could be built simply by using 60 times more compute nodes than today's fastest supercomputer; however, the cost, power consumption, and other constraints make this approach nearly impossible. Fortunately, computer scientists have an ace up their sleeves, known as a GPU accelerator. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the professional-grade cousins of the graphics card in your personal computer and are capable of performing arithmetic at a rate of several teraflops (ie. really, really fast). And a feasible route to exascale can be realized by not only making supercomputers larger but also denser. Sporting six extremely powerful GPUs per compute node, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora will follow this approach. Scheduled to come online in 2021, Aurora will be the first exascale supercomputer in North America — although the title of first in the world may go to China's Tianhe-3, which is slated to power up sometime in 2020. Several other machines in the U.S., China, Europe and Japan are scheduled to be brought to life soon after Aurora, using similar architectures What exactly does one do with all that computing power? Change the world, of course. Exascale supercomputers will allow researchers to tackle problems which were impossible to simulate using the previous generation of machines, due to the massive amounts of data and calculations involved. Small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) design, wind farm optimization and cancer drug discovery are just a few of the applications that are priorities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project. The outcomes of this project will have a broad impact and promise to fundamentally change society, both in the U.S. and abroad. So why isn't Canada building one? One reason is that exascale supercomputers come with a pretty steep sticker price. The contracts for the American machines are worth more than $500 million US each. On the other side of the Atlantic, the EU signed off on €1 billion for their own exascale supercomputer. While the U.S. and Europe have much larger populations, the annual per capita spending on large-scale computing projects demonstrates how much Canada is lagging in terms of investment. The U.S. DOE alone will spend close to $1 billion US on its national supercomputing facilities next year, a number which does not take into account spending by other federal organizations, such as the U.S. National Science Foundation. In comparison, Compute Canada — the national advanced research computing consortium providing supercomputing infrastructure to Canadian researchers — has a budget that is closer to $114 million Cdn. In its 2018 budget submission, Compute Canada clearly lays out what it will take to bring our country closer to the forefront of supercomputing on the world stage. Included is the need for increasing the annual national spending on advanced research computing infrastructure to an estimated $151 million — a 32 per cent increase from where it is now. Given cost of the American exascale supercomputers, this is likely a conservative estimate. However, the need for an exascale supercomputer in Canada does not seem to be on the radar of the decision-makers in the federal and provincial governments. Hanlon's razor would suggest that this is not due to some sinister plot by politicians to punish the nation's computer geeks; rather, our politicians likely don't fully understand the benefits of investing in the technology. For example, the recent announcement by the premiers of Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick to collaborate on aggressively developing Canada's small modular reactor (SMR) technology failed to mention the need for advanced computing resources. In contrast, corresponding U.S. DOE projects explicitly state that they will require exascale computing resources to meet their objectives. Why should the Canadian government — and you — care? For the less altruistic, a benefit of supercomputing research is ""trickle-down electronics."" The quiet but persistent legacy of the space race is technology like the microwave oven found in most kitchens. Similarly, the technological advances necessary to achieve exascale computing will also lead to lower-cost and more energy-efficient laptops, improved high-definition computer graphics, and prevalent AI in our connected devices. But more importantly for Canada, how we invest our federal dollars says a lot about what we value as a nation. It's a statement about how we value the sciences. Do we want to attract world-class researchers to our universities? Do we want Canada to be a leader in climate research, renewable energy and medical advances? It's also a statement about how much we value Canadian businesses and innovation. The user-facility model of the U.S. DOE provides businesses with access to singular resources, which gives American companies a competitive advantage in the world marketplace. Compute Canada has a similar mandate, and given the large number of startup companies and emerging industries in Canada, we leave our economy on an unequal footing without significant investments in advanced computing infrastructure. Ultimately, supercomputers are apolitical: they can just as easily be used for oil exploration as wind farming. Their benefits can be applied across the economy and throughout society to develop new products and solve problems. At a time when Canada seems so divided, building an exascale computer is the kind of project we need to bring the country together.

140,Alana India Anderson,2020-01-13T21:39:43.390Z,Why a move to Canada makes sense for Prince Harry and Meghan,"This column is an opinion by Alana India Anderson, a British-Canadian entertainment journalist and editor currently living in London, U.K. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. In recent days, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has been branded an ""ego-crazed"" leech, ""incredibly irritating,"" and ""insufferable"" by esteemed members of the British press. And yet they're shocked that she's made the decision, along with her husband Prince Harry, to leave the U.K. for North America.  On Monday, the Queen released a statement saying the Royal Family ""respect"" and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family, while remaining a valued part of the institution. ""It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the U.K.,"" it read.  Since the couple made their decision to ""step back"" from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family last Wednesday, the U.K. media has been thrown into a frenzy. How could they do this to the Queen? What does this new ""progressive role"" mean? Who will be paying for their security costs overseas?  But most importantly, why move to Canada? Having immigrated to Canada from London 20 years ago for a better quality of life, I know the appeal all too well. In fact, although I'm currently working in the media in the U.K., I still regularly visit the country that welcomed me and my family with open arms, so I'm well aware of the social and cultural differences. There's no doubt that Harry and Meghan would enjoy a relatively peaceful life if they relocate to Canada. Toronto is where Harry and Meghan started their relationship four years ago, and where she lived for several years while filming the TV series Suits. Besides familiarity, Canada offers a fresh sense of stress-free simplicity they are not afforded in the U.K. Not only is celebrity culture almost non-existent in Canada, but fascination with the Royal Family tends to take a far more friendly tone. In contrast, there's no escaping the paparazzi in places like London. While the U.K.'s reality TV stars relish the flashing bulbs of photographers, several celebrities will recall ""terrifying"" experiences of erratic driving and little to no privacy as photographers go to extreme lengths to get ""the shot."" This is because there is no governing body for paparazzi — it's a grey area. The paparazzi and tabloid culture prevalent in the U.K. is clearly something Harry is wary of. Last year, the Prince said that every camera flash ""takes him back"" to the tragedy of his mother's death in 1997, grief which he compared to a ""wound that festers."" And the media attention in Europe can be unrelenting. Kate Middleton and Prince William won £91,000 in damages in a French court verdict in 2017, for example, after topless paparazzi photographs of the Duchess were published in a French celebrity magazine. The couple said the incident was a ""serious breach of privacy."" It's telling that only one photograph emerged during Harry and Meghan's recent six-week Christmas holiday on Vancouver Island — an image they released on their own terms, showing Harry with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in front of a dazzling backdrop of water and mountains. Is it so wrong for Harry, who has not only grown up under the weight of media attention but also faced such tragedy in his life, to want some peace? After all, the couple who have put such a spotlight on mental health surely deserve to look after their own. Escaping the relentless pressure of media attention by itself isn't the only incentive for the family to leave the U.K.  Since their first meeting, Meghan's race has been the talking point of headlines adorning British tabloids. Toned-down prejudice has seen the Duchess described as having ""rich and exotic DNA"" and being ""almost straight out of Compton."" The fact that she makes mixed-race women, such as myself, feel more in-touch with their identity is merely overlooked. Despite 1.2 million people identifying as mixed-race in Britain, Meghan is often reduced to being an outsider. Meghan has openly expressed her struggle to adapt to British tabloid scrutiny, saying she ""tried to adopt"" the ""British sensibility of a stiff upper lip."" It's a struggle that now appears over, resulting in the U.K. losing a progressive and refreshing couple who are not only responsible for bringing in millions of dollars in tourism, retail and fashion, but also newspaper sales and website clicks. They wouldn't be the first members of the Royal Family to see the attraction of Canada. Speaking in Toronto in 2010, the Queen praised the ""vast, rich and varied"" country for ""inspiring its own and attracting many others."" And Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught, resided in Canada from 1911 to 1916 and acted as hostess for her father, Prince Arthur, during his term as governor general. The Princess's portrait was even on the $1 banknote issued in 1917.  Of course, there's no guarantee the paparazzi wouldn't follow them, the way they did when Charles, Diana, William and Harry visited in 1991. But a move to Canada would likely mean at least a reduction in the media scrutiny of Harry, Meghan and Archie. And that spotlight is something Harry has tried to escape his entire life, a significant curiosity about his private life which he has admitted he has ""never been comfortable with."" And it could also see the Royal Family spread its wings and become an international brand in a country where, unlike the U.S., Harry and Meghan are less regarded as ""celebrities,"" but are undeniably extremely popular. Viewed from that perspective, Harry and Meghan relocating to Canada could be a win for their family — and the Royal Family.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5422609 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harry-meghan-doc-media-1.5328618 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-harry-paparazzi-settlement-1.5138130 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5420966/royal-reporter-says-pressure-on-meghan-markle-is-typical-she-s-just-complained-more-1.5420972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025,/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5422609 /news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 /news/world/meghan-returns-to-canada-as-royal-courtiers-chart-path-for-independence-1.5421839
141,Santiago Guzmán,2020-01-12T11:30:00.858Z,"I'm new to Canada, and here's why I'm terrified of falling on ice ","Picture this: you just finished grocery shopping for the week. Standing in front of the glass door that leads to a crowded parking lot in St. John's, you see a not-so-scary snowstorm coming before you.  Luckily, you're just a couple of metres away from the bus stop, so it shouldn't be that bad. You don't take the bus regularly because of its lack of efficiency — sometimes it's easier and faster to walk, instead of waiting for an extra half-hour. This time, the bus is your best bet. Plus, the bus will leave you almost in front of your door. Sounds like a well-thought-out plan. You're trying to be positive. Although this is not your first winter in Newfoundland and you know how to deal with it, sometimes it's hard to keep yourself positive. Kudos to you. Now that you've made a plan, you put your groceries on the floor to prepare yourself to face this winter crusade: you pull out your mittens, put your warm hat on, cover your mouth and nose with your bulky scarf. You walk through the glass door.  You can feel the immediate change in temperature, and the wind. You start walking slowly, aware of the slippery street, balancing the grocery bags you're carrying. It seems like there is enough salt on the floor to protect you from sliding, and the bus stop is barely 60 metres away. Slip. Your right boot swiftly slides on an icy spot that the salt didn't cover. Miraculously, you juggle the grocery bags, as though you were on a tightrope above a hungry shark waiting for its prey to fall. You find your balance and stand still for a second. That was close! You let a laugh out, take a deep breath and try all over again. Slip. Crack.  Now you're sitting on the barely cleared sidewalk with all your groceries around you. No laughs this time. Instead, slow tears that freeze as they fall down your face. Your ankle. Despite the cold numbing your body, you can feel pain. Deep, sharp, acute pain. It's broken, you know it. In the distance, you see the bus arrive. Its passengers get out while some others hop on, and you're still on the ground in pain. No bus, no groceries, no laughs, but a broken ankle and the fear of having to go to the doctor. No, you're not afraid of needles, and prescriptions — you're afraid to have to pay fully for the medical service in the ER. You don't have health coverage. You really don't know why you're crying now, if it's the pain of your broken ankle or of depleting your minimum wage savings to pay the medical bills.  Unfortunately, the previous scenario is the fear of multiple immigrants in Newfoundland and Labrador. In order to be eligible for the provincial Medical Care Plan, you have to be a current resident of the province, and fall under one of these groups: Canadian citizen, permanent resident, international post-secondary student or international worker (with a valid work visa). It seems simple, but it's not. I put myself forward as a case study. I live in Newfoundland and Labrador. According to the Medical Care and Hospital Insurance Act, a resident is a person ""who is lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada, makes his or her home in the province, and is ordinarily present in the province but does not include a tourist, transient or visitor to the province."" Since I was pursuing my studies here, I envisioned making Newfoundland and Labrador home.  So, emotionally speaking, I would argue that I was a resident even back then. Of course, my feelings could be debatable compared with the actual number of international students who decide to remain in the province. Therefore, as students, we're only given the credit of a temporary resident, because what will happen after we graduate? Nonetheless, after graduating, I decided to stay here. I moved from Corner Brook to St. John's and signed a lease in the house I'm currently renting. I think that's enough for me to become a resident.  I am not a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident (I have all the intention to become one when I can actually afford it), and I am no longer a post-secondary student — so these are three other categories I don't qualify for. OK, but I do have a valid work permit, so I take it that I'm considered as an international worker. Well, yes but no.  I have to be employed by a Newfoundland and Labrador-based company for 12 months or longer to be eligible for MCP. I'm a self-employed artist trying to make a living from what I came to study in Newfoundland and Labrador to begin with. Securing a full-time position in my field can be quite challenging, but that hasn't stopped me from finding continuous work in my field almost since I graduated last May. However, my contract work won't be considered as full-time employment. Immigration and career consultants have worked hard with me to find a solution. They've helped me look for and connected me with available resources in order for me to get an affordable health care plan. Have I been lucky? No. The answer I've always encountered is ""you're not eligible."" Like the character in the scenario above, I'm afraid to get injured because I wouldn't be able to pay the medical bills. I blamed myself in the beginning for not looking into this situation earlier. I truly thought that this was only happening to me. However, as I became more vocal about it, I found that fellow former international students who decided to reside in N.L. have struggled with this issue as well. Why haven't we found a solution? Why is there nothing in place to support the transition of these international graduates from students-to-workers in matters of health care? Here's a tip: if you're currently an international student, want to stay in this province, and find yourself reading this article, make sure to purchase insurance with your current insurance provider within 30 days of graduating.  I wish someone had told me, because I walk my days afraid of falling.

142,Kelsey Patterson,2020-01-19T05:16:41.503Z,Canadiens hold off Vegas as Tomas Tatar notches dramatic SO winner,"Carey Price went from dejection to jubilation in a matter of minutes. Vegas scored twice in the final two minutes to force overtime with Marc-Andre Fleury on the bench for the extra skater. When Price conceded the equalizer to Reilly Smith with eight seconds left in regulation, he smashed his stick in anger. After an end-to-end overtime, Price stopped Smith with the pad in the fourth round of the shootout to claim victory. The Canadiens goaltender jumped up, threw his arms in the air and swarmed his teammates in celebration. WATCH | Habs rally to down Golden Knights in SO: ""It was important for [Price] to win that game,"" said coach Claude Julien. ""That was all that mattered to him. It's frustrating that they scored twice in the final two minutes. It wasn't pretty but it was exciting. We got two points and we'll take it."" Max Pacioretty scored against his former team with a shot from the blue line through traffic with 1:57 left in regulation before Smith tipped Paul Stastny's shot past Price. Montreal outshot Vegas 7-1 in overtime, with Fleury making highlight-reel saves on Phillip Danault and Ilya Kovalchuk on odd-man rushes to force a shootout. Tomas Tatar scored the shootout winner in the fourth round. ""[Vegas] was carrying a lot of momentum at the end of that game,"" said Price, who made 31 stops for his fourth consecutive victory. ""They were making a push. We pushed back well in the overtime and found a way to do it in the shootout."" The Canadiens (22-21-7) have won four of their last five games as they enter their bye week clinging to slim playoff chances. ""We've been playing some pretty good hockey,"" added Price. ""If we can continue to do that, and understand what's making us successful, we have to carry that momentum after the break."" Montreal took a commanding 3-0 lead on nine shots after the first 20 minutes. Nick Cousins slid the puck under Fleury's outstretched pad at 5:51, his first of the game, on a pass from Dale Weise behind the net. The 36-year-old Kovalchuk scored his fourth in a Canadiens uniform to double the lead at 12:33. Fleury denied Kovalchuk's initial shot in close but he couldn't stop the Russian's second effort. The goal was Kovalchuk's first at Bell Centre since 2011. His first three goals since joining Montreal came on the road. ""Unbelievable hockey city,"" said Kovalchuk, who has eight points in eight games with his new team. ""I never played in an environment like this. I appreciate it and we're going to keep going. We're going to keep pushing."" The home team went up 3-0 when Joel Armia deflected Brett Kulak's shot and beat Fleury five-hole for his career-high 13th of the season. Fleury stopped 28-of-32 shots in defeat. In the second game under new coach Peter DeBoer, the Golden Knights (25-19-6) scored twice in the second period to come within one. An unmarked Jonathan Marchessault tallied from the slot on a pass from Smith behind the net at 9:08. Veteran Stastny jammed a loose puck past Price to make it 3-2 at 14:47. ""We're getting off to slow starts and teams are capitalizing,"" said Smith, who has 20 goals this season. ""We have to find a away to turn that around. It's too hard to come back in every game."" Cousins scored his second of the game on a 2-on-1 with Weise at 9:40 of the third to give Montreal a 4-2 advantage. ""It's nice to get rewarded,"" said Cousins of his fourth line. ""We're all hard-working guys. We all play a similar style. I'm just fortunate enough to be on the end and finishing plays.

Canadian live lobster exports to China, mostly from Nova Scotia, soared after China slapped retaliatory tariffs of 35 per cent on U.S. lobsters. U.S. lobster exports tanked while Canadian sales jumped by 123 per cent, worth a record $384 million, during the 10 months of 2019. The new trade deal does not lower those tariffs. But China has pledged to buy $32 billion worth of American agricultural products over the next two years, including lobster and other seafood products. Rahaman says the Chinese government has the clout to compel its companies to switch back to lobster from the United States. He calls it ""pseudo-capitalism."" ""They have private corporations who are heavily indebted to state-owned banks and, through that channel, China can actually direct trade and commerce,"" he said. ""I understand there is a lot of skepticism on whether they will actually follow through on the promises they have made. But if they really want to do it they can deliver on this promise."" Rahaman added: ""We're going to pay a price in terms of our seafood market access to the Chinese market."" Keith Colwell, Nova Scotia's minister of fisheries and aquaculture, said the province has nothing to fear. ""Basically, it won't make any difference for us."" ""We can sell everything we can catch. We sell top-quality products. We send it on time and their customers are very happy with it."" Global Affairs Canada said it continues to monitor the China-U.S. deal.

144,Caitlyn Gowriluk,2020-01-17T11:00:00.853Z,2 infants died after not receiving emergency air transport to Winnipeg Children's Hospital: report,"Two infants died after not receiving emergency air transport to Winnipeg's Children's Hospital near the end of 2018, Manitoba Health's latest critical incident report reveals. One of the infants was taken by ground ambulance to the hospital because air transport was not available, the quarterly report says. The infant, who was in unstable condition, had a heart attack on arrival. The report, released on Thursday, says intubation was difficult, and the infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Treatment was later withdrawn and the infant died. Another infant, who was premature and in unstable condition, was also taken to the hospital by ground ambulance. The report says transportation by the Lifeflight air ambulance was declined. The infant had surgery for a bowel obstruction and died the next day. While the exact circumstances of the deaths are not known, the two incidents happened at a time when tensions were high between Lifeflight staff and the province — which oversaw the air ambulance service for decades before shuffling it over to Shared Health, the organization that co-ordinates health care in Manitoba, last October. In December 2018, the doctors who work for the air ambulance service threatened to stop working on private medevac planes if the province didn't hire more pilots and fund annually required training for pilots, citing safety concerns. The move came after the province signalled the possibility of privatizing the flights. The critical incident report, released quarterly by the province, details serious health-care events reported to Manitoba Health. It provides short descriptions of each event, but does not provide identifying factors or specific locations. ""While we can provide general information on recommendations that have come from critical incidents, we are unable to provide information about specific incidents (including recommendations),"" a provincial spokesperson said. The two-page Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2018, report lists 30 such incidents. Of those, seven resulted in death. The report also lists a patient who fractured a hip after being pushed onto the floor by another patient as a major incident and not a death — although the patient died two days later. The report also refers to an incident where a patient died after a STARS air ambulance arrived almost two hours after being called and without a doctor. The patient initially arrived at the emergency room with chest pain and had a heart attack, but was resuscitated. A transfer via a STARS air ambulance was needed, but the ambulance arrived almost two hours later without a physician on board, the report says. Staff were initially unable to intubate the patient, and later made the decision to transport the person by ground, but the patient was dead on arrival at the destination, the report says. The report says another patient, who was supposed to be supervised during mealtimes, choked to death while eating unsupervised. The report says the need to supervise the patient ""was not consistently communicated to the entire care team."" The report also details misdiagnoses, including a patient who received an invasive procedure that was not indicated for their condition. Another didn't get expert consultation for a skin condition that turned out to be misdiagnosed, resulting in a delay in appropriate treatment. A patient who was assessed for an acute condition and sent home later died after ""the opportunity to immediately consult expert medical services to assess the patient's risk was not realized,"" the report says. The report also details falls that led to serious injuries, and a miscalculation that led to a medication overdose, requiring the patient to be resuscitated.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/critical-incidents-manitoba-winter-2018-healthcare-1.5429195,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-shared-health-takeover-1.5336152 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-air-ambulance-doctors-refuse-1.5199326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/critical-incidents-manitoba-summer-2018-healthcare-1.5362916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/critical-incidents-healthcare-2018-1.5290716,/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-manitoba-air-ambulance-privatization-government-1.5190928 /news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-health-critical-incidents-1.4987783 /news/canada/manitoba/grade-12-student-winnipeg-dies-complications-influenza-1.5425612 /news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-hospital-overcapacity-issues-1.5417799 /news/canada/manitoba/nurses-health-sciences-centre-safety-winnipeg-grey-listing-1.5413925
145,Emily Chung,2020-01-20T14:47:38.887Z,"Goodbye, gas furnaces? Why electrification is the future of home heating","It's a stereotype, but it's true — Canada's winters are cold. And many of us stay toasty by burning fossil fuels such as natural gas in our furnaces or the boilers that feed our radiators. In an effort to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and meet targets to reduce global warming, the U.K. has proposed banning fossil fuel-based heating in new homes by 2025. Cities in the states of California, Washington and Massachusetts are also trying to phase out natural gas. If your home is hooked up to a district heating system, where a utility supplies heat directly, you may be able to tap into a variety of greener energy sources.  But if your home relies on its own individual heating system, as most do, what are the alternatives to fossil fuels and will they work in the colder parts of this country? Here's a closer look. About 45 per cent of Canada's emissions come from burning fossil fuels to make energy, including heat and electricity — quite a bit more than transportation (28 per cent), the Prairie Climate Centre reports. Of that, about half is from houses, shops, schools and other private and public buildings. The other half is from industry. Nearly 70 per cent of the energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil fuels, a 2014 study estimated. Forced air furnaces and hot water or steam boilers with radiators, which most often burn fossil fuels such as natural gas, make up a majority of the primary heating systems in Canada, Statistics Canada reports. ""Very important,"" said Fin MacDonald, program manager of the Zero Carbon Building program at the Canada Green Building Council, a non-profit that advocates for and certifies green buildings. In provinces such as B.C., Ontario and Quebec whose power grids don't produce a lot of emissions, fossil fuel combustion from buildings represents the biggest source of carbon dioxide, he said. That's certainly the case in Vancouver, where more than half the greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings, said Brady Faught, green buildings engineer with the city. While people may be concerned about a car idling for 10 minutes, Faught says ""your house is basically idling all day."" And it's not just the gas it's burning that's the problem. Natural gas or methane — a greenhouse gas that traps heat far more effectively than carbon dioxide, causing much more global warming per molecule — also leaks from the entire distribution system used to deliver gas to people's homes and furnaces, Faught said. Buildings heated with fossil fuels can cut some of their emissions by reducing the need for heating through things like better insulation and reusing ""waste"" heat. But in order to make a big difference, the green building industry is looking to electrify heating. ""The only fuel that we can truly make 100 per cent carbon neutral is electricity,"" MacDonald said. That's why the City of Vancouver is trying to come up with regulations and incentives for homeowners to electrify their home heating. ""The ultimate goal is zero emissions,"" said Faught, whose job is to develop policies to encourage green retrofits for single-family homes in Vancouver. In provinces with an electrical grid based mostly on hydro, nuclear or other non-fossil fuel energy sources, such as Ontario, Quebec and B.C., replacing a gas-burning furnace with an electrical heating system can nearly eliminate a home's emissions. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, power is largely generated by burning fossil fuels. For now, homeowners who want to cut heating emissions need to go beyond electrification and also install green power generation, such as solar panels. Baseboard heaters are the most common option in use across Canada. They're powered by electrical resistance heating, just like your toaster and oven. Electric forced air furnaces, electric convection heaters and electric radiant floors also use electrical resistance heating. Heat pumps are far more efficient, because they simply move heat into your home, rather than generating heat. There are two kinds: Air source heat pumps, which draw heat from the air. (Yes, it can work even when it is very cold outside, just as your freezer can use its heat pump to cool itself to -18 C in a 20 C kitchen.)  Ground source heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground and are sometimes referred to as geoexchange or geothermal heat pumps. However, MacDonald says the industry is trying to move away from calling it geothermal, as it gets confused with geothermal power generation. Baseboard heaters are popular because they're very cheap and easy to install. However, those and other kinds of electrical resistance heaters are very inefficient. ""They're like just having a toaster running in your house all day … resulting in high electric bills,"" said Faught. For those reasons, baseboard heaters are often popular in rental units where landlords install them and tenants pay the cost of electricity. That said, it's possible to bring the cost down in a small home by making the building more airtight and better insulated. David Turnbull, a former homebuilder and current manager of Enerspec Energy Consulting, said his company built a townhome complex in Edmonton where units were relatively small and so well-insulated that ""you could almost heat the house with two hair dryers."" In that case, baseboard heating made financial sense. Heat pumps are way more efficient than electrical resistance heating. Both MacDonald and Faught say it's possible to get 300 per cent efficiency from a heat pump — that is, you can get three kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity you put in. They're especially efficient in spring and fall.   However, MacDonald says heat pumps tend to produce a lower temperature heat than burning fossil fuels, and therefore don't heat a building as quickly. That means a building needs to be airtight and well insulated to keep the heat from escaping and reduce the ""heating load"" before you should consider this as an option — and even more so the further north you go. Faught says air source heat pumps can heat an airtight, well-insulated home to a comfortable temperature until it gets to about -10 C outside. In places with colder winters than that, supplementing with baseboard heaters may be necessary with conventional air source heat pumps. However, some manufacturers have brought cold climate heat pumps on the market that they say can deal with outside temperatures down to -25 C or -30 C. One big advantage of heat pumps is that they don't just heat homes, they can also cool them. In fact, air conditioners are technically heat pumps. The difference with the heat pumps capable of heating homes is they can run in reverse. Air source heat pumps are cheaper and easier to install, but less efficient and more expensive to run. That's because the ground temperature tends to remain stable all year round — containing more heat in the winter and more ""coolness"" in the summer than the air. However, ground source heat pumps tend to be a lot more expensive — and require more space — to install because it's necessary to dig deep to access stable underground temperatures. That can be particularly costly in places where the ground is bedrock, said Turnbull. It's more economical if you're building on clay or sand, he said, and especially if you're digging anyway — for a parkade, for example. Solar power is useful for generating green energy to run devices like heat pumps in provinces with a fossil fuel-based electricity grid. However, there's also solar thermal energy, where heat is collected directly rather than by generating electricity. MacDonald said that tends to be more expensive than other options and requires lots of space for the solar panels. Because most of the heat is collected in summer, it also needs to be stored somewhere. ""If you have a pool, perfect,"" he said. If you have a ground source heat pump, in theory you can also store the heat in its underground heat exchange loop. Turnbull and Faught both think solar technology is not quite ready for heating individual homes in Canada (although solar thermal heating with storage has been successfully tested for district heating in Okotoks, Alta.). In Canada, the federal government is holding public consultations on proposed changes to the National Building Code and its National Energy Code for Buildings. Some jurisdictions such as Vancouver are also coming up with their own regulations and incentives to encourage electrification, especially in new homes. The city's climate emergency response report  proposes that by 2025, all new and replacement heating and hot water systems should be zero emissions.  ""Having a fully electric house without a gas line is the direction we want to go,"" Faught said. Turnbull says governments need to plan to phase out fossil fuels in home heating. ""It's an inevitability that we are going to get off them.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-home-certified-as-alberta-s-1st-passive-house-1.4803890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/district-energy-1.5378650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-home-heating-carbon-emissions-1.5429492 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/passive-house-affordable-housing-1.4432331,/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-home-heating-carbon-emissions-1.5429492 /news/canada/calgary/calgary-home-certified-as-alberta-s-1st-passive-house-1.4803890 /news/technology/district-energy-1.5378650 /news/canada/ottawa/net-zero-homes-ontario-climate-change-1.3637515 /news/canada/saskatchewan/opinion-net-zero-emissions-can-be-done-1.5357000 /news/technology/passive-house-affordable-housing-1.4432331 /news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-blatchford-1.5345452

They were scheduled to leave on Jan. 13, but the day before, the Taal volcano erupted, spewing ash, and prompting evacuations of nearby communities. ""The day it happened, we were at the airport the whole day and it was, well, you could imagine the airport was full of thousands of people trying to get their flights booked back home,"" Stephen said.  ""So we had to be in a queue for the day and we eventually got in to our airline, and had the soonest flight we could get, and that was the 26th."" The Bells are staying with relatives in Pililla, Rizal province, southeast of Manilla, and about 150 kilometres from the volcano. ""It took some time for us to actually feel the effects,"" Stephen said. But by nightfall, ash from the volcano had ""blanketed our whole community."" For the Bells, their primary concern as they wait to leave the country is the health of their children. Stephen said most people are wearing masks and eye protection.  They are keeping their kids indoors, to protect them from the ash.  ""We are quite concerned about their health though, for sure."" An added concern is access to suitable food for their 10-month-old daughter, Gabrielle. Stephen said she has a dietary condition, which means there are many foods she can't eat. The family brought their own food on the trip with them, but never expected they would be there so long. They've been able to find food locally, but the situation is stressful, Stephen said.  ""We're really trying to get back home to get her diet back on track here, for her health.""  Stephen said the conditions in the community where his family is staying are ""pretty stable,"" but he worries things could get worse before they are able to leave. The volcano continued to send out plumes of ash throughout the week. ""We are getting, you know, daily reports from the news that there could be a catastrophic eruption with this volcano,"" Stephen said.  ""We're living our daily lives here, but there's always that, you know, that stress in the back of our minds that you know something worse could happen, and we'd be stuck here for much much longer.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bell-family-stuck-in-philippines-1.5431468,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/volcano-philippines-evacuations-taal-1.5429720 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-westjet-charlottetown-calgary-jan-2020-1.5430670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-program-seniors-chours-jan-2020-1.5431114,[]

An unidentified person petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asking for an investigation into the problem. An agency document outlining the allegations shows 127 owner complaints to the government that include 110 crashes and 52 injuries. The agency says the allegations include about 500,000 Tesla Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2013 through 2019 model years. The agency's investigations office will evaluate the petition and decide if it should open a formal probe. Messages were left Friday morning seeking comment from Tesla. The petition adds to a growing list of federal investigations into the Palo Alto, California, automaker's vehicles. NHTSA is investigating three December crashes involving Tesla vehicles in which three people were killed. The agency's special crash investigations unit sent teams to Gardena, California, and near Terre Haute, Indiana to probe two fatal crashes. Another crash in Connecticut also is under investigation. Also, the National Transportation Safety Board will hold a hearing Feb. 25 on a separate fatal crash in Mountain View, California, involving a Tesla that was operating on the company's Autopilot driver assist system. Authorities are trying to determine whether the cars were operating on Autopilot, a system designed to keep a car in its lane and a safe distance from other vehicles. Autopilot also can change lanes on its own. Tesla has said repeatedly that its Autopilot system is designed only to assist drivers, who must still pay attention and be ready to intervene at all times. The company contends that Teslas with Autopilot are safer than vehicles without it, but cautions that the system does not prevent all crashes. NHTSA's crash program has inspected 23 crashes involving vehicles that the agency believed were operating on some form of partially automated advanced driver assist system. Fourteen of these cases involved Tesla models. The team investigates more than 100 crashes per year.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-acceleration-complain-1.5430654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-s-self-driving-autopilot-system-under-scrutiny-1.5413931 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-electric-truck-1.5369304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-posts-surprise-quarterly-profit-1.5332815,[]
148,Ariana Kelland,2019-12-18T10:48:09.612Z,Jennifer Hillier-Penney took estranged husband off life insurance 2 weeks before she disappeared,"Two weeks before Jennifer Hillier-Penney vanished from her estranged husband's house in a remote Newfoundland town, she removed him as a beneficiary on her life insurance policy. For her oldest daughter, Marina Penney, that gesture says a lot about what her mother was thinking in the days leading up to her disappearance in St. Anthony. ""She knew that something was going to happen to her,"" Penney said from her Clarenville home this week. ""She was living in fear."" Hillier-Penney disappeared from Dean Penney's home on Nov. 30, 2016. Documents show the change in her life insurance policy — removing Dean Penney and leaving her two daughters as beneficiaries — was signed and dated on Nov. 16, 2016. ""The 16th of November, as I know it, it was the day her life was threatened. She went back to work that day and she had her friend witness those changes to take my dad off that policy,"" Marina Penney said.  The RCMP have not named any suspects in the suspicious disappearance of Hillier-Penney. Documents, however, indicate the Mounties believe she was kidnapped and killed.  The RCMP are not commenting on the existence of the life insurance policy or what it could mean. ""All tips and any new information received are being pursued,"" RCMP spokesperson Glenda Power said in an email. ""Police do feel there are people who may have information relevant to the investigation who have not come forward."" Marina Penney said she knew about the change in her mother's policy shortly after she went missing. But after three years without answers, she's decided to take it upon herself to reveal details she believes are important in the case. She posted the policy documents on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her mother.  ""There were very few people that knew that had happened, and I'm to the point now where I just need to put her story out there,"" Marina Penney said.  ""People need to know that."" Hillier-Penney went to her estranged husband's home that night to stay with their daughter, Deana.  Dean Penney told The Fifth Estate last year he was going hunting at their cabin in Northwest Arm, 45 minutes away. The next morning, her daughter woke to find her mother's cellphone, purse, jacket and books were still inside the house. Her vehicle was also still outside.   Police believe she disappeared around 8 p.m. Before she disappeared, Hillier-Penney was looking into leaving her estranged husband and her hometown behind, her daughter said. She had a job interview lined up in Glovertown. Friends of Hillier-Penney have said she expressed fear over leaving Penney. ""Jennifer told me … that he said that he would make away with her. And they would never find her. Like she knew that,"" friend Vicki Burden told The Fifth Estate in 2018. ""She had said stuff to me, but not to the extent she told other people,"" Marina Penney said. ""She just didn't want to burden me with it."" Dean Penney did return to his home the night of Hillier-Penney's disappearance, he told The Fifth Estate, to get his duck decoys. Penney said last year he has no knowledge of what happened to Hillier-Penney. Marina Penney is unable to move forward until her mother's body is found. ""I'm in limbo. A lot of anger right now. Coming up on the third year, the weight of all this is heavy,"" she said. For three years, she has racked her brain thinking of where her mother could be. She has no doubt she's dead. Those suspicions have torn Marina Penney's family on both sides apart, she said, ""No one looks at each other the same anymore."" Dean Penney's lawyer, Bob Simmonds, declined comment when reached by phone Tuesday about the change in Hillier-Penney's life insurance policy.  In the years following Hillier-Penney's disappearance, Marina Penney has longed to have her mother near her — especially when she had her first child, who's now 19 months old.  It's not about what Marina has missed, she insists, but about the life her mother never got to live.  ""She was 38 years old. She had plans. She was sick of living a miserable life and she wanted to do more for herself,"" Marina Penney said. ""She wanted to be happy and that was taken from her."" What tears Marina Penney up inside is knowing her grandfather went to his grave in August without knowing what happened to his daughter. ""In the last three years, he spent so much time sat down by himself consumed by his own thoughts,"" she said. ""That killed him. It was too hard on his heart."" The RCMP were granted an extension last Thursday to hold items seized from Dean Penney's home, the family cabin and a vehicle. Some exhibits have been tested at the RCMP's national crime lab in Ottawa, while others may need to be sent for analysis. ""If they had hard evidence, somebody would be in jail,"" Marina Penney said.  Penney said she's not confident in the case that the RCMP is building, and has been disillusioned by the investigation.  ""It's not that [the RCMP] don't want her found. They want her found more than anything but they got to start taking more action. Because people are going to start doing it themselves.""

149,Jordan Gill,2020-01-20T14:45:54.904Z,Brother and sister find shared success in filmmaking,"Kennlin Barlow remembers the moment he first thought of becoming a filmmaker. It was his older sister, Natasha Barlow, who inspired him. She sparked his interest in moving pictures by showing the four-year-old Bride of Chucky. ""Even though it scared the living hell out of me, after that I just couldn't stop watching movies,"" said Kennlin. ""In retrospect, I probably would never show a four-year-old a horror movie like that now, but I was a teenager at the time,"" said Natasha. Decades later, the two are a brother-and-sister team. Both filmmakers in their own right, they help each other out with filming and acting. Now both of them have found an outlet to screen their films. Films from both of them have been selected for St. Thomas University's Indigenous Film Festival, which begins at the end of the month. Natasha said it's exciting for the Indian Island First Nation, outside Richibucto, duo. ""I never thought something like this could happen,"" she said. She said film has always been something that's connected the two, even though she only recently found out the extent of that connection. ""I had never realized probably until the last year that he used to steal my movies,"" she said. ""He would then quote them and I didn't realize like he had watched some of my films."" It's not always easy working with family, however. Natasha said sometimes it can be hard to get any work done, especially when the two of them start laughing. ""We love to laugh when we get together, so sometimes there's been instances when it's taken us a little longer to complete projects,"" she said. But it's not always laughing that keeps the pair form working well. Kennlin recalls a time when he cut much of his sister's performance from his film Mancanti. He had insecurities over the script. ""I wasn't happy with the script I wrote I unfortunately cut it out,"" said Kennlin. ""That decision did not feel good."" Natasha admits she wasn't happy, especially considering she had to memorize lines of dialogue. But she now looks back at the dispute as a teaching moment. ""I find it very funny now,"" said Natasha. ""If I have to memorize anything I guess I'll be a little more aware that things will change with Kennlin."" The feeling of love and deep respect between the two is apparent. This comes, in no small part, from their different approaches to filmmaking. Natasha calls her brother a ""creative genius"" for his avant-garde, non-narrative approach to film. ""I just want people to see how great he is,"" said Natasha.  ""It bothers me when people do not understand his vision."" Meanwhile, Kennlin considers his sister fundamental to his filmmaking, noting that while her filmmaking could be considered more mainstream and conventional, she is willing to broach subjects he still finds difficult even to talk about. ""My topics have never really been focused on Indigenous issues,"" said Kennlin. ""My sister is a lot braver when it comes to that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brother-sister-film-making-1.5432676,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/indigenous-filmmakers-stu-fredericton-1.5405129,/news/canada/new-brunswick/indigenous-filmmakers-stu-fredericton-1.5405129
150,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-05T10:30:00.081Z,NB Power spent more than $178K US on Florida lab this year,"NB Power has spent more than $178,000 US this year to run a lab in Florida at the home of Joi Scientific, a company that claims to have found an efficient way to convert seawater to hydrogen. But the lab may not be open for much longer, as questions swirl about whether Joi Scientific's technology works as previously described. NB Power spent $178,413 US (about $237,325 Cdn) on costs associated with the lab, according to records obtained by CBC through access to information. The records capture costs between February, when NB Power opened the lab, up to Oct. 16, 2019. The biggest expense in running the Florida lab has been the $42,372 US for standard lab equipment, followed by  $38,694 US for support staff. The records don't specify how many people were considered support staff or how many people may have been brought in to work in the lab. Other costs included instrumentation, H2 specific equipment, a work station and rent and utilities at the facility, located at the Space Life Sciences Lab at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla., where Joi Scientific is headquartered. Two former Joi Scientific employees interviewed by CBC News have raised questions about Joi's technology, saying it doesn't work as previously described. Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland has also said there's no proof Joi's technology is viable. Earlier this month, Holland said the NB Power lab in Florida will continue to stay open until the end of 2019, as a final test is underway to determine the technology's viability. ""Once [the test is] completed, either you send me somebody from MIT who says, 'Eureka!' or it didn't deliver the results and then we wrap things up,"" Holland said on CBC New Brunswick's Political Panel in November. A spokesperson for Joi Scientific did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday before deadline. Last month, Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, acknowledged the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them. Her emailed statement didn't elaborate on those delays or challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement from November said. NB Power spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology, with the help of the Regional Development Corporation. NB Power planned to keep the Florida lab operating ""until we can make a decision whether we can go forward or not,"" NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas told CBC News last month. He said the utility was doing that to ensure it could recoup some of the investment it made in Joi's technology. But the utility hasn't budgeted any money for its Florida lab in the 2020-21 fiscal year, according to documents the utility filed with the Energy and Utilities Board on Tuesday. ""NB Power is obligated to make payments related to the lab space and related equipment until the end of January 2020,"" the documents say. ""The payment for January 2020 is US$16,717. There are no other continuing obligations. NB Power will maintain the licensing rights should there be no further testing or funding by NB Power."" After NB Power's latest rate application, New Brunswick's public intervener, Heather Black, asked the utility to provide Joi Scientific's ""most recent evaluation of the technology and its potential economic viability."" But in its response, NB Power said it couldn't answer those questions ""due to strict confidentiality requirements."" In response to a question from Black about whether NB Power has decided to ""pull the plug"" on the initiative, NB Power said Joi's ""technology is producing hydrogen from seawater,"" but the utility didn't provide further details. ""Additional testing is scheduled in the December time frame which will determine future direction,"" NB Power wrote in its filing. In a separate filing, the EUB asked the utility whether outside experts were asked to help evaluate the investment in Joi Scientific. ""With respect to the Joi Scientific initiative, NB Power had access to third party validation testing,"" NB Power wrote in response. ""NB Power also engaged its own third party to conduct testing."" The utility has never identified the third party that may have validated the testing and hasn't released copies of the those tests, citing a confidentiality agreement signed with Joi Scientific. Both the public intervener and NB Power declined requests for interviews about the utility's EUB filings. Do you have a tip about this story?

151,Aly Thomson,2020-01-19T10:00:00.835Z,These feral cats once roamed a remote N.L. island. Now they live in Maritime barns ,"It's quite a step up from roaming the rocky shores of a remote Newfoundland island in sub-zero temperatures, scrounging for food and shelter. After travelling 1,000 kilometres by land and sea, 40 feral cats from Little Bay Islands, N.L., are settling into their new homes in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  Most of the cats ⁠— 29 of them — have been sent to warm barns, some sharing space with horses and chickens. ""They're very cute,"" said Shannon Doane, who took in two of the cats to help with rodent control at her barn in Elmsdale, N.S. ""They're very skittish because they are feral, but they're not completely wild."" The cats were rescued by volunteers at the Halifax-based charity Spay Day HRM Society, who heard about the plight of the animals and their imminent doom due to the permanent departure of the island's 54 residents. Citizens of Little Bay Islands voted in favour of accepting government financial relocation assistance last year, meaning services like power and water were cut off on Dec. 31. Although the cats were feral, many were fed by and interacted with the island's residents, which raised concerns about whether they would survive once everyone was gone. After arriving at a makeshift shelter in Dartmouth, N.S., the cats were checked by vets and spayed or neutered. They were then assessed to determine where they should be placed. One of the cats ⁠— likely an abandoned pet ⁠— was friendly enough to be put up for adoption through the SPCA. Another 10 have been placed in foster homes in the hopes they will become socialized for eventual adoption. The cats considered too feral to be socialized were found homes through the charity's barn cat program. Cats live inside hobby or commercial barns and have access to food, water and warm shelter. Three of those felines have hit the jackpot. They're living in Wendy Stewart's guesthouse in the coastal community of Halls Harbour, N.S. Stewart said she originally intended to keep the critters in a drafty barn on her property, used mostly to store firewood. But she also had an empty guesthouse and so she decided to move the cats in there. ""These cats were just rescued from a cold place. I wanted them to be warm,"" said Stewart, who has only named one of the cats so far — Clifford — since she's waiting for the other two to show more personality. Stewart said the cats ⁠— two black and white and one all black ⁠— spend most of their time in a loft and occasionally leap onto a stack of rolled-up rugs to peer out of windows, surveying their new environment from high above. Once they become acclimated, Stewart will open up an already-installed cat door on the guesthouse so they can come and go as they please. She said the felines are already warming up to their new digs. ""I just gather from their posture, their body language, that they're more relaxed than they were a week ago when they arrived,"" said Stewart. Doane's cats are currently being confined to a horse stall in her barn while they become familiar with life in Elmsdale, which includes having chickens as roommates. They have a heated bed inside a large dog crate. There is a heated water bowl, cat tree, cat toys and bales of hay for climbing. She, too, has yet to name the cats, as she's waiting for them to show their individuality. She hopes they will eventually become socialized enough that she'll be able to approach and pet them. ""They've gotten comfortable enough with me that when I go in and feed them, if I sit quietly in the stall with them and read, they will eventually come out and eat,"" she said. ""The little black one is a little more adventurous than the black and white one and he'll come out and walk around the stall, around the perimeter, and doesn't seem to mind too much that I'm there."" Linda Felix, president of Spay Day HRM, said the cats have been sent to barns all across Nova Scotia and one in P.E.I. She said they were sent in groups of two or three and one group of five. ""They always have buddy,"" said Felix, adding there were three colonies on the N.L. island. ""We match them with cats from the same colony where they were trapped, so they went with a cat they would know and wouldn't be alone and afraid."" Felix said the cats currently in foster care are younger — between five and six months old — and so there is more of a chance they can be socialized. If not, they will find homes for them through the barn cat program.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/newfoundland-little-bay-islands-feral-cats-nova-scotia-rescued-barn-1.5432139,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/late-fee-renew-licence-frustrates-n-s-doctor-1.5431493 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/rocky-johnson-curtis-bowles-johnson-1.5429494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/border-collies-seized-new-homes-1.5428233 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/total-loss-fire-insurance-policy-recovery-guide-1.5429182,[]

We will take measures for the victims and their families according to our own laws,"" he said.  In his speech, Mousavi also criticized Canada for following diplomatic pressures imposed by United States, saying Iran had announced its ""readiness to have a consular section"" but the requests had been ignored by the Canadian government.  ""Yet they don't even allow hundreds of thousands of Iranians who are in Canada to use basic consular services …. And now, in this type of situation, they are worried about Iranians."" Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the federal government cut diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012. The Liberals pledged to re-engage with the country in 2015, but to date, bilateral relations have not been renewed. As protests erupted in Iran over the plane disaster, the British ambassador in Tehran was briefly detained. Officials said he was at an ""illegal"" rally, while the envoy said he was attending a vigil for victims. Britain criticized his detention. ""Iran respects all foreign diplomats in Iran as long as they do not violate international laws,"" Mousavi said. Aurel Braun, professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, said Iran's statement was tantamount to denying the Canadian citizenship of those killed.  ""It complicates co-operation [with Canada] when recovering remains and investigating the crash. It just makes everything vastly more difficult,"" Braun told CBC News.  Refusing to acknowledge dual citizenship was a ""matter of control,"" and a signal to those travelling the country that they are subject to the ""whims of the totality of the regime's power,"" he said.   ""It is a fear of external interference."" Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne's office told CBC News that Canada has had assurance from Iran that the deceased families' wishes would be respected regarding where remains would go.  ""We continue to expect that that will be the case and have been clear with the Iranians about that expectation,"" spokesperson Adam Austen said.  Also on Monday, Ukraine urged Iran to return the black boxes from the downed plane. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said returning the boxes would show that Iran was committed to an unbiased investigation. Prystaiko was speaking as an Iranian delegation led by Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami was visiting Kyiv to discuss the Jan. 8 tragedy. ""His main task is to apologize and acknowledge what happened. We hope that we can go a little further than just political discussions and discuss practical problems. Among them in particular is the return of the black boxes,"" Prystaiko told reporters. Iran said on Sunday it was trying to analyze the black boxes, denying an earlier report it would give them to Ukraine. ""At first they stated that they were handing them over, then the same person stated that they were not handing them over. This created some misunderstanding in Ukraine and we were starting to be asked: are they being handed over or not?"" The office of President Volodymyr Zelensky said Iranian experts were expected to assess Ukraine's technical ability to decode the black boxes. A statement said the wreckage of the aircraft was to be returned to Ukraine. ""I promised the families and relatives of the victims, I promised the people of Ukraine that the truth will be established. We must know what happened,"" the statement quoted Zelensky as telling the Iranian minister.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/iran-dual-nationals-downed-ukrainian-plane-iranians-1.5432918,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/compensation-victims-ps752-1.5424415 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-ukraine-plane-crash-black-boxes-1.5432118 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847,/news/world/iran-ukraine-plane-crash-black-boxes-1.5432118 /news/thenational/anger-in-iran-over-flight-752-1.5425866 /news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 /news/world/iran-jetliner-unintentionally-shot-down-1.5423608 https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/
153,Anonymous,2020-01-20T18:35:36.281Z,"Reconciliation can't happen without reclamation of land, argues Max FineDay ","Max FineDay is not yet 30 years old, but he's making his mark as he travels across the country talking about reconciliation to Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. He's a nêhiyaw napew from the Sweetgrass First Nation in Saskatchewan, Treaty 6 Territory and the executive director of Canada Roots Exchange — a national Indigenous youth-led charity empowering youth to shape the future of truth and reconciliation in this country. His goal is to clear a path for Indigenous youth to set their sights high and to achieve economic and personal success. ""I tell stories to people who haven't seen what I've seen so that they can be called to do something, called to learn, called to change their behaviour,"" he said in a lecture at Vancouver Island University, as part of the fifth annual Indigenous Speaker Series in Nanaimo, British Columbia. His lecture was a witty and powerful reminder of the urgency when it comes to issues of Indigenous justice. Although FineDay believes that there is potential for change, he emphasized that this is an issue that continues to linger between generations — a narrative of trauma without a full stop, but one that can be reconciled with collective action.  ""It's a story yet without an ending,"" FineDay said.  ""It's a story so far about tragedy, with moments of triumph. So rare is it a moment in our lives that we know we're in the middle of what we know to be an incredible story ... We have the opportunity to direct its conclusion, to play a part in finding its ending."" FineDay carries the pain of his generation — the trauma of children born into dire circumstances out of their control.  In his talk, he highlighted how the intergenerational pain among Indigenous youth has led to young children taking their own lives. He referred to an incident in northwestern Saskatchewan in which a 10-year-old committed suicide and a state of emergency was declared following multiple incidents.  ""Youth from the community sent a letter to their chief and counsel, but I think it's a letter for all of us,"" FineDay said. ""Enclosed in it are the hopes and the heartaches of a generation. The aspirations and actions they so desperately want. Please help us understand who we are as a people."" The powerful lecture was accompanied with a question and answer session.  Here is part of that discussion.  Audience member: I'm deeply disturbed that young people internalize [their frustrations] and then commit suicide. As a grandfather and parent, just as a person and as an Indigenous person, I struggle with the idea that a 10-year-old would would be in such a deep dark place across this country ... that they would feel they need to take their own lives. What is it that you think we should be doing now? I wish I could say this is an isolated incident, that it doesn't happen too often and it's rare but that would be a lie. It was just a few months earlier that another 10-year-old chose the same route in southern Saskatchewan. How do we call ourselves the 'just country?' I'm not one for eliciting societal change through guilt. That's not the path of change or progress that I usually seek. But, you know, my blood boils every time I hear of another young person who has decided that there is absolutely no other way to live in one of the top five best countries in the world as rated by the United Nations Human Development Index. I think that one of the things we need before we get to reconciliation is storytelling. We need truth-telling and we need to talk about that colonization that hasn't left our communities and our people. In my community we're dealing with a father who stabbed his son and I think that for us, it is life and death. I'm losing patience and I worry about my kids. I want to run away from my people. But I do think that what we go through in community isn't shared — there's a secrecy. I wonder how we share this without people shutting down? As you know in our rush to reconciliation so often we turn away from truth. We know that truth as we have been taught is the sibling of reconciliation. We know that they come together, they come as a pair. Do you hear what this this woman said to you? This place has some difficulty of its own. Do you hear what this woman said to you? That there is so much truth left unspoken. Do you hear what this woman said to you? She worries for her children.  This isn't far away. This isn't some skeleton in some basement of our history. Now I wish I had an answer for you. The truth is hard to tell. I get berated by some of our people for being too gentle with Canadians. If I'm honest, I'm not sure that we are ready as a country to tell the full truth. I know that the Indigenous people in this room could tell some stories that would be hard to listen to, if not impossible. You feel that pit in your stomach that uncomfortableness that makes you shift in your seats. We are Canadians. We're supposed to be this great defender of human rights, the good guy on the international stage.  These are the things that we're proud of. How far we have yet to go. The most frustrating part, and I feel that, too — that frustration, is that it's not up to you and me how fast this gets to happen. It's up to Canadians how far they're willing to go for us, how quickly they will seek to to find peace, prosperity and mutual benefit among us. For new immigrants, many people coming from a different country, they don't know about Indigenous issues. It took me a decade just to find out what everything meant ... Do you think something is being done on those lines? It's so crucial and I think we've done a really bad job as a country including new Canadians and including people of colour in this reconciliation. Even our own leadership will often dilute it too. You know, we were talking at lunch about how in Toronto you can hear five languages on any given block. Once you've arrived on these lands, you are a party to the agreements, to the treaties, to the history of this country. We've been doing a lot of work at Canadian Roots Exchange to engage with new Canadian communities and communities of colour to make sure that they see themselves reflected. We know that new Canadians, and first generation Canadians, are going to be a huge part of the workforce, of the economy. They are going to be employers, people of prominence and influence. If we don't educate them on this beautiful history of Indigenous people, on the challenging realities that we face today, we're missing a crucial constituency ... We need to normalize conversations with new Canadians as part of reconciliation.

154,Don Pittis,2020-01-16T09:00:00.544Z,Investment giant's move toward sustainability offers hope for climate activism: Don Pittis,"One of the reasons people are worried climate change will be almost impossible to stop is that pumping carbon into the atmosphere is simply way too profitable. Even as new reports yesterday from NASA and the British weather service showed climate change had created the hottest decade in history, according to the traditional rules of capitalism, if companies make fortunes from digging coal and building pipelines, then nothing is going to stop them. With so much money at stake, not only do shareholders and employees get onside, but governments may often be persuaded to actively back increased carbon output, even when they have evidence it will ultimately damage the local and global economy. That's why this week's announcement by BlackRock — often described as the world's richest money manager, with about $10 trillion to invest (no, the T is not a mistake) — is both surprising and encouraging. Although it is easy for climate activists to insist BlackRock has not gone far enough, the moves it has made — seen partly as a response to outrage that the company's previous green talk was just that, talk — appear to offer evidence that business can be swayed by public pressure. The news is especially interesting because, while global in scope, BlackRock is a U.S. company — a country where the Trump administration seems to be doing everything it can to stand in the way of climate action, from defanging the Environmental Protection Agency to withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. That is not the way things are supposed to work, and according to people like energy economist Mark Jaccard, it is governments that must be forced by public pressure to take the lead on climate change. ""You need to get climate-sincere politicians in there; you have to be able to identify them and you have to keep them there,"" Jaccard said in a recent interview. ""And it turns out with something like climate change, that's really difficult."" Jaccard is the kind of guy who supports anything that works to solve the climate problem, but, as he contends in his book The Citizen's Guide to Climate Success, we must not depend on the motive of profit.   Because of the low cost and high commercial efficiency of continuing to use fossil fuels, the only effective climate action entails voters forcing governments to change the rules. While most climate advocates say that remains true, BlackRock's moves to cut investments in companies that earn more than 25 per cent of their revenue from fossil fuels, get out of coal, and require companies in which it invests to reveal their level of climate risk (sometimes called climate transparency) seem to belie the idea that corporations have no morals. Many commentators scoff at that idea, including Ian McGugan, who writes in The Globe and Mail that ""BlackRock's Green Investing Strategy is Not a Moral Awakening."" Like many others, however, he concedes that huge protests specifically naming the company have likely influenced its change in focus. It may be that coal is simply a bad investment today. But the fact that ""the world's most powerful investor"" says so too makes it harder to ignore. And while it is easy to say that green credentials are just an exercise in public relations, expressions of public morality, such as the campaign against blood diamonds, have had a real business impact. As with all moral questions, the argument over whether business leaders are merely parroting a growing public anxiety to earn greater respect applies just as well to the rest of us. On the other hand, companies are not just machines. They are organizations made up of people, some of whom worry about the world their children and grandchildren will inherit. And even in giant corporations, opinions on climate change matter.  Also this week, James Murdoch, son of global media mogul Rupert Murdoch (and a company board member), made global headlines when he criticized News Corporation's influential media outlets for promoting climate denial during Australia's recent fires. BlackRock's new position on climate is no reason for activists to stop worrying; as Jaccard insists, government rules and public pressure remain crucial.  And as the company has outlined, one of the reasons to begin adjusting its portfolio now is that a groundswell of public and (some) government support for climate action means climate-unfriendly businesses will no longer be good investments. For a company investing for the future, that matters. ""Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,"" said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in a letter to company executives. Yesterday, the World Economic Forum, whose annual Davos gathering of the very rich and powerful which begins next week, released its latest annual risk report, titled 15 Years of Risk: From Economic Collapse to Planetary Devastation. Four of the Top 5 worries delineated by the world's business and political elite had to do with climate. In the past, the activist group BlackRock's Big Problem have accused the investment giant of being ""the biggest driver of climate chaos you've never heard of."" And while it remains to be seen whether the company's efforts will truly make a difference, at the very least, its latest move means a lot more people now have heard of them.

155,Bradlyn Oakes,2020-01-18T15:00:00.285Z,Think it's cold where you are? Yukon was the coldest place on Earth this week ,"January's weather this year has people across the country doing the same thing: bundling up.  Extreme cold, snowfall records and blizzards are among the events that have touched almost all parts of Canada.  The latest deep freeze through Yukon has brought extreme temperatures that were some of the coldest in the world and have persisted for over a week. Out of the fifteen coldest places on Earth recorded Friday, eleven were in the Canadian territories, according to WXNow, an extreme weather tracking website.  And all but one of these were in the Yukon.  On Friday, Carmacks reached a bone-chilling –49.8 C, beating its previous cold record for Jan. 17. Mayo was a close second at –49.4 C.   Other communities in Yukon also continued their stretch of –40 C temperatures: Faro at –46.7 C; Beaver Creek at –44.9 C; and Dawson with –44.4 C — coming in third, fourth and fifth respectively.  Unsurprisingly, most of the locations outside Canada ranked as coldest on Earth were in Alaska, just over the Yukon border.  So, what caused the Yukon to be the coldest place on the planet? That pesky high-pressure ridge that has been stuck over the territory for more than a week.  This ridge brought temperatures to Yukon and N.W.T. that were well below normal. Extreme cold warnings were in effect for more than a week in some cases, and wind chills feeling like it was below –55 C.  Now, that ridge is making its way out of the territory and the end is in sight for these cold temperatures as we head into early next week.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/coldest-place-on-earth-yukon-1.5431812,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-vehicle-set-fire-cold-1.5428598 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bradlyn-oakes-weather-blog-1.5389968,/news/canada/north/arctic-chill-extreme-cold-nwt-1.5394615 /news/canada/north/arctic-cold-stalled-over-yukon-1.5421454 /news/canada/north/freezing-flower-weather-yellowknife-1.5423404
156,Anonymous,2020-01-16T19:15:03.832Z,Microsoft says it will be 'carbon-negative' — not just neutral — by 2030 ,"Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it aims to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits by 2030 and that by 2050, it hopes to have taken out enough to account for all the direct emissions the company has ever made. The focus on removing existing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft's climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones. Speaking from a stage at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., Chief Executive Satya Nadella said that corporations need to create profitable solutions for the problems of both people and planet. ""If the last decade has taught us anything, it's that technology built without these principles can do more harm than good,"" he said. ""We must begin to offset the damaging effects of climate change,"" he said, adding if global temperatures continue to rise unabated, ""the results will be devastating."" The announcement by the world's largest software company is the latest in a flurry of climate goals set out by firms after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change. Microsoft plans to cut its carbon emissions by more than half by 2030 across its supply chain. The plan includes the creation of a ""Climate Innovation Fund,"" which will invest $1 billion US over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology. ""When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. He added that the effort ""will require technology by 2030 that doesn't fully exist today,"" Microsoft will also expand an internal fee that it has charged to its business groups to account for their carbon emissions, Smith said. Since 2012, Microsoft assessed the fee on direct emissions, electricity use and air travel, among other activities, but will expand it to cover all Microsoft-related emissions. ""That money is used, then, for us to invest in our work to reduce our carbon emissions,"" he said. Co-founder Bill Gates was an early backer of British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, one of a handful of companies developing direct air capture technology. Microsoft's goal to have removed enough carbon by 2050 to account for all its emissions since its founding in 1975 encompasses direct emissions from sources such as company vehicles and indirect emissions from electricity use, it said. But even as technology companies have stepped in with their own climate goal plans, they have faced criticism from their employees for doing too little. Amazon.com Inc, the world's largest online retailer, last year pledged to be ""net zero carbon"" by 2040 and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from a startup, after employee activists pushed the retailer to take a tougher stance on climate change. Microsoft plans to become net zero carbon a decade earlier than Amazon, although this is in part because its emissions are roughly a third less. Microsoft expects to release 16 million tonnes of CO2 in 2020, including indirect emissions from activities like corporate travel. Amazon runs a bigger cloud business than Microsoft and a massive retail and logistics organization, with packaging, delivery and customer trips to its chain of Whole Foods stores all piling on to its carbon footprint. Including indirect sources, it emitted more than 44 million tonnes of carbon in 2018. It was not immediately clear if the figures reported by the companies were exactly comparable. Both Microsoft and Amazon have come under fire from activist tech workers who have demanded they stop supplying technology to oil and gas companies. Microsoft in 2017 announced a multi-year deal to sell cloud services to U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp In a blog post, Microsoft on Thursday reiterated its commitment to working with oil and gas companies. ""It's imperative that we enable energy companies to transition, including to renewable energy and to the development and use of negative emission technologies like carbon capture and storage and direct air capture,"" Microsoft said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/microsoft-cabon-negative-1.5429484,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/carbon-capture-faq-1.5250140 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/data-centres-energy-consumption-1.5391269,/news/technology/climate-2019-1.5427586 /news/technology/carbon-capture-faq-1.5250140 /news/business/amazon-climate-1.5291076 /news/technology/data-centres-energy-consumption-1.5391269 https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/
157,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-23T20:00:43.698Z,'Is that even legal?': Companies may be sharing new credit or debit card information without you knowing,"A Vancouver woman is sounding the alarm for millions of Canadians who have credit and debit cards, after information about her debit card was shared when it shouldn't have been. Vanessa Acuña blames an ""updating service"" that some credit and debit card companies have that allows new account numbers and expiry dates to be shared with merchants customers have dealt with in the past.  Information about the sharing of this kind of information with third party companies is often buried in the fine print of bank and credit card agreements. She thought the details of her Visa debit card — a debit card that can be used for online purchases — were secure. ""[I thought], 'How is this legal?'"" Acuña said after discovering PayPal was given the new expiry date on her Visa debit card without her knowledge. Visa — and other major credit cards — have ""updater"" programs, that automatically provide updated customer credit card information to subscribing merchants, including account numbers and expiry dates. Companies automatically opt-in their customers to the service, whether they realize it or not.  The program is meant to be a convenience for customers and help merchants avoid missed payments on recurring bills. ""I have huge privacy concerns … I would really prefer that they tell you and give you an option to opt out of it. But that's not what they did."" The merchants who get the automatic updates pay for the service.   Thomas Keenan, author of TechnoCreep — a book about how technology is eroding privacy — says financial institutions need to ask themselves if they should be making money by sharing customers' information.  ""Banks make a business out of information sharing. They actually have services — Visa, MasterCard — and they are paid to share that information,"" said Keenan.  Acuña believes that updater service is the reason the online payment system got her card information when it shouldn't have — but when she tried to find out why it happened, she couldn't. Acuña thought what happened to her private information was her decision, when PayPal sent an email in March asking her to update her debit card's expiry date.  She says she ignored the request, since she opened the account five years ago and rarely shops online and didn't want PayPal to have her new card information.  ""Two days afterwards, I got another email saying, 'Oh we updated for you, so you don't have to.' And I just thought 'what?'"" Acuña said. She spent hours on the phone with TD Canada Trust, PayPal and Visa Canada, but instead of getting an explanation, she got three different answers. PayPal told Acuña it got her new expiry date from her ""financial institution or her credit card company.""  Visa and TD both denied giving PayPal that information. ""[They said] they don't know who gave PayPal my information, which I don't think is a very good answer,"" Acuña said. It turns out Acuña's information shouldn't have been shared at all, since only Visa credit — not debit — cards are part of the updating agreement with TD. Yet, none of the three companies involved will explain how her new debit card data ended up with PayPal.  After initially telling Go Public it got Acuña's information from the ""account update services,"" PayPal  backtracked a few days later, saying the account updater service ""doesn't apply"" in Acuña's case. So, how did PayPal get her new expiry date? It won't say, citing customer confidentiality — even though Acuña agreed to waive confidentiality to allow the company to answer Go Public's questions. Visa Canada and TD also won't say who gave her card's new expiry date to PayPal.  ""Visa does not automatically update expiry date information on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders,"" a Visa spokesperson said in an email. ""Please refer your questions to PayPal."" ""TD has no ability to automatically update expiry date information with merchants on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders. For more information about the service, we recommend reaching out to Visa,"" wrote Geraldine Anderson from the bank's public relations department. The lack of answers is why banks and credit card companies shouldn't be sharing any credit or debit card information without clear consent from customers, says Ann Cavoukian, who heads up the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence at Ryerson University in Toronto.  ""It's totally unacceptable,"" said Cavoukian, who worked as Ontario's information and privacy commissioner from 1997-2014. ""PayPal is one thing. But your own personal bank where your financial info is stored and kept? As I keep telling businesses, this is not your information. The information belongs to the individual."" She wants to see banks get what she calls ""positive informed consent"" before providing a third party with a customer's information.  ""The banks have to step up and do this. They can't just assume you're OK with them sharing your new credit information.""  Cavoukian wants to see Canada's privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, upgraded to match the one the European Union introduced in May. The General Data Protection Regulation is considered to have some of the world's strictest online privacy rules. For now, if customers want to stop merchants from getting updated credit card information, they have to opt out through their banks — although it's unclear if that would have helped Acuña. ""I'm capable of putting in my information online if I need to. It's not a hassle for me, so I definitely would like the option,"" Acuña said She says from now on, she'll take the time to read through all the legalese on those lengthy card agreements, and make sure she opts out of anything that allows financial institutions to share her information with third parties.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

158,Lien Yeung,2020-01-20T13:00:00.372Z,Four Seasons Hotel closure brings 43-year tradition of billionaire power lunches to an end,"While sitting at his table at Yew Restaurant inside the Four Seasons Hotel, Joe Segal jokes he could hold a mortgage on the hotel with how much money he's spent there. ""Weddings, anniversaries, I had my ninetieth birthday here,"" says the billionaire philanthropist. His joke isn't far from the truth; Segal's relationship with the hotel runs deep. Now 95, he's been having lunch there for 43 years — five days a week. He likens it to his marriage of 71 years to his wife, Rosalie. There were growing pains — the restaurant has had many new servers, chefs, managers — but they've always worked through it. ""You either learn to adjust or you fall apart because you don't get along,"" he says. ""This place has been everything I've needed."" It's a chapter that's coming to a close; the Four Seasons Hotel is shutting its doors Monday after more than 40 years in business. The lease for the property hasn't been renewed. Instead, landlord Cadillac Fairview announced Friday it's in negotiations with several other high-end hotel brands as potential replacements. In 2017, Cadillac Fairview sued the hotel, alleging it looked ""tired"" and outdated. The Four Seasons denied the allegations. Segal acknowledges the hotel might have become a ""little dowdy,"" but he has nothing but the highest praise for its staff. ""This place is really what I would term, as close to perfection as you can get, and besides that, they give me anything I want,"" he said with a laugh. Segal started hosting daily business lunches at the Four Seasons because it was next door to his office but he says it was the exemplary service that won him over. He once remarked that his regular table, a four-top, was too small and his papers were falling off. ""The next day, I had a bigger table,"" he said. The replacement table looked exactly like the old one but was six inches wider, designed just for him. Segal signed some of the biggest deals of his career during lunch at the Four Seasons, like his 1988 acquisition of Block Brothers Realty, which turned the war veteran into a real estate magnate. ""I made that deal right here, over this table, $150 million."" Despite the big dollars being tossed around over prawns and spinach, Segal's friends say advice from the astute businessman has been the biggest draw.  Lessons like the need for honesty. ""Never tell a lie, period,"" publisher Peter Legge said of his greatest learning from Segal.  ""You can make mistakes but always be honest in your dealings with people."" Segal isn't the only high profile guest that's hob-knobbed at the Four Seasons. Staff say regulars included former attorney general Wally Oppal and jazz pianist Diana Krall. During his five-year tenure, former executive chef Ned Bell remembers cooking for Jean Chrétien, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Bublé, who was a big fan of B.C. dungeness crab. ""You know I used to look out and say like, holy smokes guys, we're cooking for the elite but also the people that run the city,"" Bell said. The Rennie has arrived! The key, value-added touch that justifies the $23 price is the blueberry jam. <a href=""https://t.co/9rMkjC4kBj"">pic.twitter.com/9rMkjC4kBj</a> He put a grilled cheese sandwich on the menu named after condominium king Bob Rennie, who custom-ordered it regularly for two years. Bell goes down as Segal's favourite chef. Both men say they will miss the hotel but the ever-optmistic Segal is ready to move on. The hotel offered to let him take his table and chairs home but he turned them down. ""Why didn't I take them?"" he said. ""I didn't because once this is gone it's gone. And you don't live in the past. You live in the present and you look to the future."" Segal promises his teachings are going to continue. The nonagenarian already has new lunch spots lined up. ""Gotham's could be one [option], Hy's could be two, Hawksworth's could be three, the food court could be four,"" he said. ""I won't go hungry.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/four-seasons-closes-joe-segal-1.5428364,[],http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia
159,Jamie Strashin,2020-01-21T03:50:10.316Z,'He deserves to be there': Canadian baseball community wants Larry Walker in the Hall of Fame,"Larry Walker's climb toward induction into the hallowed halls of the National Baseball Hall of Fame has been a slow one. The gatekeepers to Cooperstown, the baseball journalists who cast the votes that determine which players go in and which ones don't, have been slow to embrace the Canadian outfielder's career and his indelible mark on America's game. But at a recent banquet in Toronto, where a roster of Canadian baseball legends gathered for the Canadian National Team Awards, the verdict on Larry Walker was unanimous. ""You ask people in this room and he is the greatest,"" says Vancouver's Jeff Francis, a pitcher who spent 11 years in the major leagues, including eight with the Colorado Rockies, the team Walker had his best years after starting his career with the Montreal Expos. ""Of course we're all biased and we want to see a Canadian get in, but I think the numbers speak for themselves."" ""He has all of the personal accolades you could ask for for a guy to be in the Hall of Fame. He deserves to be there,"" adds former first baseman Justin Morneau, who along with Walker is one of only three Canadians to be named league MVP. Joey Votto, first baseman with the Cincinnati Reds, is the other. ""Whether he is Canadian, American, Puerto Rican, he is a guy whose numbers stand up and his play stands up against anybody in the history of baseball."" WATCH | Jamie Strashin makes the case for Larry Walker on The National: If he is inducted, Walker, now 53, would be just the second Canadian and first position player so honoured. Pitcher Ferguson Jenkins, from Chatham, Ont., was inducted in 1991. For the native of Maple Ridge, B.C., this year is his last chance to join the exclusive club. To this point, Walker's candidacy since being put on the ballot in 2011 — he retired in 2005 — has been treated with relative indifference by voters, never coming close to the required 75 per cent needed for entry. But this year could be different. According to Ryan Thibodaux, whose website tracks eligible voters, Walker is on pace for more than 85 per cent support of voters who have made their ballots public. Baseball is game of numbers and statistics and Walker's have always been a source of controversy. His most successful offensive seasons were played in the thin air of Coors Field in Denver, where the ball travels further, inflating offensive statistics. During Walker's decade-long run in Colorado he hit .384 at home, compared with only .280 on the road. But a deeper dive into Walker's numbers is illuminating and surprising at almost every turn. Walker is one of only 21 players in history to be a member of the 300/400/500 club, finishing his 17 seasons with a .313 career batting average, a .400 on-base percentage and .565 slugging percentage. He also amassed a long list of personal accolades: He could also run the bases, totalling 230 stolen bases for his career. ""He was the kind of player who did everything well. We all knew he could hit, but he hit home runs, hit for average,"" Francis says. ""I played for a lot of the same coaches growing up and they could never say enough about his defensive ability, his base-running ability, his baseball instincts."" His statistics would be much loftier but for the injuries that sidelined Walker for lengthy stretches during the prime of his career. From 1996-2004, Walker missed 375 games, the equivalent of more than two seasons. Most of Walker's career was played during an era that subsequently came to be defined by performance-enhancing drugs, something Walker has never been accused of or linked to. Walker has rarely talked about his candidacy for the Hall of Fame, but after coming up short last year with just 54.6 per cent of the ballots, his frustration was clear in an interview with a Montreal radio station. ""I played for a major-league team that happened to be in Denver,"" Walker said. ""If that's a problem, and there's going to be an issue, then get rid of the team and move it elsewhere if it's going to be that big of an issue. No needles went in my ass, I played the game clean. It's almost like Coors Field is my PED."" That Walker is even in a position to be inducted into the Hall of Fame is improbable. In an era where most players arrive as polished products, the result of years of specialized training, Walker spent as much time growing up in Maple Ridge playing hockey, dreaming of being an NHL goaltender, as he did playing baseball. ""Hockey was my first love,"" Walker told CBC in 1993. ""We played maybe 20 [baseball] games a season when I was a youngster."" There was no baseball team at his high school, and even when he did play, it was mostly fast pitch, where pitchers throw the ball underhand with top speeds around 70 mph, as opposed to the 90 mph-plus that's typical in baseball. Walker was never drafted, instead signing as a free agent with the Montreal Expos for a meagre $1,500 US bonus after attracting the attention of scouts at the 1984 World Youth Baseball Championships in Saskatchewan. His rise through the minors was hardly meteoric as he struggled to adjust to professional baseball. ""Back home all I really saw were fastballs and what were supposed to be curveballs but didn't do anything but really spin,"" Walker told CBC. ""I had to learn a lot of new pitches — the slider, the forkball, the splitter. The pitchers were just so much more advanced because they had high school and college ball. I was able to play at their level but I had to work a lot harder."" Walker was always easy to cheer for. It's hard to find an unkind word written or said about him, and always maintaining the quintessential Canadian humility. Former pitcher Jason Dickson, now president of Baseball Canada, remembers meeting Walker during the outfielder's 1997 MVP season. ""I obviously spot him as soon as I see him because of the Canadian connection. He's an established big-league guy and of course I've been watching him when he played with the Expos,"" Dickson says. ""And he came right over to me and we had a chance to talk. And I remember telling my dad that night that I had a chance to meet Larry Walker. We all know the numbers side but he was the person I had always hoped he would be and he was exactly that way"" ""I have never been let down by Larry,"" says Morneau, who wore Walker's No. 33 in tribute when he played in Colorado in 2014-15. ""When you're around him you realize how much he cares about people, how much he looks out for his fellow Canadians. He has a big personality but his ego doesn't match it. It's amazing how humble he is, what he does for other people."" Even if Walker falls short of the Hall of Fame, his impact on Canadian baseball continues to run deep. Since his retirement, Walker has appeared as a coach numerous times for Team Canada at various international competitions. ""With our young players he is still very relevant in what he says and sharing everything he knows about the game, how to play it the right way,"" Dickson says. ""The kids love working with him. He is easy to approach, talk about hitting, he's seen it all, he means a lot for us."" Above all, he has given a generation of Canadian baseball players hope that anything is possible. Maybe even the Hall of Fame. ""Maybe it will influence some younger Canadians to pick baseball over another sport,"" Morneau says. ""We have tremendous athletes in this country and if we can steer more towards baseball we'll hopefully have more guys like Larry in the future.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-baseball-hall-of-fame-canadians-1.5430934,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-hall-of-fame-vote-raines-1.5433746 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/mlb-colorado-rockies-larry-walker-1.5431222 https://www.cbc.ca/archives/how-canada-s-fergie-jenkins-pitched-his-way-to-the-hall-of-fame-1.4991633 https://www.cbc.ca/archives/larry-walker-the-mvp-ballplayer-who-actually-wanted-to-play-hockey-1.5053554,/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-hall-of-fame-vote-raines-1.5433746 /archives/how-canada-s-fergie-jenkins-pitched-his-way-to-the-hall-of-fame-1.4991633 /archives/larry-walker-the-mvp-ballplayer-who-actually-wanted-to-play-hockey-1.5053554 https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/walkela01.shtml
160,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-06-03T16:11:59.509Z,'Appalling treatment': Couple in wheelchairs left alone for almost 12 hours at Vancouver airport,"The son of an elderly couple says he wants two major airlines to stop blaming each other and take responsibility for abandoning his parents in their wheelchairs for half a day, with no help to access food, water or a washroom. Mohan Karki's parents, who don't speak English and require assistance to travel, were found almost 12 hours after being dropped off at a service counter at the Vancouver airport — just not by the airlines responsible for assisting them during their trip, WestJet and Cathay Pacific.  ""We were thinking they were somewhere in the corner of the airport ... not knowing where to go,"" said Karki. ""My parents told me, 'We never left this place' … 12 hours they were there. They tried to communicate with some other people, passersby, and nobody responded to them. Maybe they couldn't understand what they were saying."" On Feb. 23, Chhaya and Narayan Karki, aged 66 and 69, were on the final leg of a trip from their home in Kathmandu, Nepal, to visit their son and his family in Edmonton, with a stopover in Vancouver.  Mohan Karki said Cathay Pacific told him it delivered his parents to the WestJet customer service counter at the airport, and WestJet was to transport the pair to the gate for their final flight to Edmonton.  When his parents failed to arrive, a worried Karki spent hours on the phone trying to track them down. They didn't have a cellphone. ""For about six or seven hours, I kept on calling both airlines, but they never found my parents,"" he said.  Karki then called the RCMP. It took officers 20 minutes to find the couple, located just steps from the service counter. The couple had placards with Karki's name and phone number, in case of an emergency. No one responded when they tried to get help by holding them up, he said. According to an Ontario-based advocate for people with disabilities, services for those who need assistance travelling are ""unreliable and inconsistent"" because airlines are allowed to set their own rules — instead of being told to meet specific standards. ""It is appalling treatment … the regulator should make it clear that [airlines] can't pass the buck to each other,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. Thanh Phan shares that frustration; the same thing happened to his 76-year-old mother at the same airport. In August, Niem Thi Le, who has trouble walking and doesn't speak English, was left in a wheelchair for eight hours after being dropped off at the wrong departure gate by WestJet. Le was on her way home to Hanoi, Vietnam, after visiting family in Victoria. WestJet was supposed to connect her with China Southern Airlines for her next flight. ""My mom told me that the wheelchair attendant just left her there without talking to anyone.… I was shocked … this is a human being,"" Phan said. An employee with another airline eventually noticed Le sitting alone, found someone who could speak Vietnamese and brought the woman to the China Southern Airlines counter. That airline contacted Phan and suggested he call WestJet to find out what happened. He did, asking if someone could help his mother until he could get there himself. ""I said, 'Could you please help her give her some food and drinks.'... They said, no, they didn't do anything wrong and that's not their business,"" Phan said. He called China Southern Airlines back and it agreed to help, bringing Le a hamburger and a drink. Phan complained to customer service and WestJet apologized, saying it would review its internal process. But he said the airline never got back to him to explain what happened. WestJet also told him travellers who don't speak English shouldn't be travelling alone, he said, though they offered him a $100 travel voucher. ""It's very frustrating because they blame passengers, and they did not think that is a serious problem."" Both Phan and Karki are still demanding an explanation from the airlines involved in their respective cases.  ""We sincerely apologize for the stress and worry that these guests and their families experienced,"" WestJet's media relations manager Lauren Stewart wrote in an email to Go Public. ""The nature of these incidents is serious, and we are in touch with both airline partners involved to investigate and make enhancements to our processes to prevent this type of incident from happening again. We are also reaching out to the families involved.""  The airline says it provides mobility assistance to more than 900 guests per day. Cathay Pacific told Go Public it was sorry to hear what happened to the Karkis, adding it followed ""standard operating procedure"" when it delivered the couple to WestJet staff and exchanged wheelchairs. ""The proper turnover to WestJet was made by our staff. Additionally, we are in the process of reviewing this situation with WestJet and we will apply learnings from this experience to future transitions between our airlines,"" wrote Julie Jarratt, the airline's communications director. Lepofsky, who is blind, said he's had his own problems travelling. ""I dread entering Canadian airspace if I'm travelling alone … not because the service is always bad, but because it's not reliably and consistently good."" Airlines have a duty to accommodate passengers with disabilities under Canada's human rights laws, he said. But when that doesn't happen, it's tough to figure out where to turn for help. ""There are multiple agencies involved,"" Lepofsky said. ""The Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Transportation Agency — and you could be kicked from one to the other, trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. ""The Canadian Transportation Agency, where you're often kicked to, does not, from the perspective of people with disabilities, have a good track record in this area."" The CTA says it's aware some of the standards are out of date and a binding set of rules is needed. Until now, accessible transportation has been governed by mostly voluntary codes of practice.  The agency has proposed new accessible transportation regulations for airlines and all travel providers. The new rules would be legally binding and impose penalties up to $25,000 for non-compliance. And if another proposed law passes, the Accessible Canada Act, that fine could jump to a maximum of $250,000. ""They need to make sure that passengers don't fall between the cracks,"" said Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency. Under the CTA's proposed rules, airlines would have to provide people who need assistance a place to wait, near personnel who can assist them and will ""periodically inquire"" about the person's needs. Airports would be responsible for providing assistance from curbside to check-in, while the airlines would be responsible from check-in to boarding.  Streiner said the proposed recommendations would have helped in both cases. The agency plans to have the final regulations published before summer and hopes to have the majority of requirements in place in about a year. ""Persons who require wheelchair assistance, including older Canadians, absolutely are covered by these regulations,"" Streiner said. ""We want to make sure that there's no confusion about who's providing assistance and that people aren't left without assistance."" As for Karki, he said that the next time his parents visit, he won't leave them in the hands of the airlines. Instead, he'll try to match their itinerary with other Nepali-speaking travellers. After hearing from Go Public, WestJet called Karki last week, promising an explanation once it looks into what went wrong. Phan said WestJet has yet to follow up with him, adding that his mother is now afraid to travel and will no longer come visit.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

162,Brooklyn Currie,2020-01-18T10:00:00.418Z,This N.S. man's family lost everything in a house fire. Here's what he learned,"Brian Verboom and his family had only been out of their Stewiacke, N.S., home for a few minutes when they got word from a family member on vacation in Texas that the Verboom's house was on fire. The family member said a friend had texted her a photo of the burning home. ""That's social media for you,"" said Verboom. The family had been out running errands and by the time the Verbooms made the seven-minute drive back to the house on July 25, 2018, one end of it was completely engulfed in flames. Investigators determined the cause was electrical, Verboom said. He said the hardest thing to lose in the fire was the family photos of Verboom, his wife, Rae-Lee, and their five children. ""Our youngest daughter, most of hers are online that we can get back. But our older daughters, most of those pictures were physical pictures in photo albums,"" Verboom said. After the fire, the couple spent almost 40 hours a week for an entire month making a detailed inventory of their possessions — including their age, how much was paid for them and current value — and going back and forth with their insurance company. ""[It] is the most time-consuming, physically, emotionally, and mentally draining thing you have to do,"" he said. Through his loss, Verboom's hoping to help other families in a similar situation put their lives back together. He wrote an informal nine-page guide called ""What we learned from a total loss fire,"" which he shared on Facebook. One of his pieces of advice is for people to catalogue their possessions. The list isn't just for large items like furniture and appliances — it's clothes, shoes, books, even things like coat hangers and toiletries. A year and a half after the fire, Verboom said he's still remembering things he forgot to list. ""Every little thing adds up, especially if you have to go and replace it all at once,"" he said. ""You just never think of it when you do it through the years."" Verboom suggests keeping all receipts and doing a walk-through video tour of your home every six months, to prove the condition of things like cabinets and furniture, and help jog your memory as you're making a complete inventory of everything you've ever owned. This is in line with what the Insurance Brokers Association of Nova Scotia suggests you do to protect your belongings, whether it's from fire, theft or other damage. Gina McFetridge, a spokesperson for IBANS, said a ""small minority"" of people actually do it. ""No one would disagree that it's a great idea, but the second you finish putting that policy in place, you go home ... and it all falls to the back-burner. You forget about it,"" she said. ""We're not preparing for disaster every day."" Verboom said it's important to be meticulous about listing your possessions and to know just how much it would cost to rebuild your home. He recommends bringing in a contractor to have them quote you. ""We were way off,"" he said, noting the cost to rebuild the home was about $80,000 more than the insurance policy covered. In the end, Verboom and his family bought a prefabricated home for the property instead of rebuilding. ""[It was] late fall, early winter ... it would get us into a house sooner​​​​​​,"" he said. Verboom said the thing that surprised him the most throughout the process was how many costs would come out of their total insurance payout that he hadn't considered, like demolition, food, hotels and salvage costs. Verboom said he's received a lot of positive feedback from people about the guide. ""I hope nobody has to use it ... but if anybody does, I hope it makes the situation for them easier to get through,"" he said.

The Affordable Home Ownership Capital Grant & Tax Exemption program — under the housing incentives policy — was expected to be suspended until the end of 2020 but the city will be discussing the suspension at the Mayor's Housing Commission meeting on Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. CST. The tax exemption was created to help increase the number of homes on the market but home prices slumped in Regina by 4.6 per cent due to an oversupply in 2019, according to the the Canadian Real Estate Association. Early in 2019, the city suspended the tax exemption for one year, with the option to review if the exemption was necessary at a later date.  Pending a discussion Monday, the suspension may no longer apply to non-profit housing providers in new and developing neighbourhoods, including Uplands, Sherwood Park, Prairie View, Dewdney East and Arcola East. The city says this is because non-profit housing providers have proven they can complete affordable homes with an immediate rebate as long as they have entered a legal agreement with the city.  The city also noted there are other incentives to build a home, including the National Housing Co-Investment Fund launched in November 2017 and the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation's First Time Home Buyer Incentive program. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/city-of-regina-tax-exemption-may-be-reinstated-non-profits-1.5432971,[],/news/canada/saskatchewan/vacancy-rate-up-but-so-is-rent-1.5304215 /news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-landlords-offer-rent-incentives-as-vacancy-rises-1.3428832 /news/canada/saskatchewan/home-sales-regina-1.5428934
164,George Maratos,2020-01-19T12:00:00.792Z,This Yukon teen bikes to school year round — even in -40 C,"How cold is too cold when it comes to riding your bike in the winter? It's a question that 13-year-old Phineas Pearson of Whitehorse, a dedicated winter cyclist, doesn't know the answer to.  ""I guess –50 would be too cold. I've never biked in –50."" This week, despite the temperature hovering around –40 C, he still hopped on his bike and rode to school. He's the only student at F. H. Collins who rides every day, no matter the weather. ""I do this because it's something I enjoy and in the cold temperatures it really wakes you up and gets you ready for school,"" he said.   ""I had an exam the other morning and when I came to school, I was very awake and normally I would be very, very tired.""  Pearson comes by his enthusiasm for biking honestly.  Both his parents are avid cyclists and the bicycle has been his go-to mode of transport since he was in kindergarten. At age five, he would hop on his dad's extra-cycle, an adult bike that has an attachment on the back specially designed for smaller riders. Just two years later, Pearson was riding alone to school. ""That was really hard for me, but they need their independence,"" said Phineas' mom, Georgi Pearson. ""We've always biked as a family and I'm proud of the fact that he just does it. It's just kind of how we get around."" Living in downtown Whitehorse, Georgi says they rarely have to use a car. ""If we go out the door, there's a good chance we're bringing a bike with us."" For the past week, the roads in Whitehorse have been quieter than normal. The city is under a cold snap like it hasn't experienced in years, and many people have elected to park the vehicle and stay inside. Not Phineas. On Tuesday, just before noon, he had an exam. And while most high school students would probably have been doing some last-minute cramming, Phineas was more focused on making sure he was geared up properly. ""I have to wear snowpants, a large winter jacket, a sweater, hats, mitts and a buff — not necessarily in that order,"" he said. ""A good jacket is definitely the most important."" Phineas says he doesn't really notice the cold except on the bridge of his nose, which is exposed at times. He says the cold is harder on the bike than him. ""It seizes up about halfway to school and gets really hard to pedal,"" he said. ""But the experience of biking in –40 isn't as unbelievable as you might think, it's just like going for a walk in the cold."" The bike Phineas rides is not cheap, and it can withstand the elements of a Yukon winter. It's a fat bike, and comes equipped with special gloves on the handlebars called pogies, that provide warmth. The main feature is the bike's extra-wide tires, designed for comfort and control. ""It feels kind of like driving a tank, and does feel very powerful,"" he said. Georgi says on top of giving her son independence the biking also allows Phineas to exercise without even realizing it. ""He's a book reader, and cycling is a good way for us to get him to have some physical activity without him maybe realizing he is,"" said Georgi. ""He probably does know that that's our ulterior motive.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bike-winter-high-school-fat-bike-yukon-year-round-1.5431709,[],/news/canada/sudbury/fat-bike-james-bay-coast-ice-road-1.5019808 /news/canada/toronto/fat-tires-and-adapted-trikes-an-east-york-program-wants-kids-of-all-abilities-to-ride-a-bike-1.5136248 /news/canada/manitoba/fat-bike-ride-and-kids-bike-building-marathon-1.5388491 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-trail-etiquette-freezing-jan-2020-1.5413343 /news/canada/new-brunswick/winter-cycling-fat-bikes-1.5420753

""No energy company will be unaffected by clean energy transitions,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, in a statement Monday. The IEA is an independent non-governmental organization that advises countries and industry on sustainable energy. The world is demanding energy services and emissions reductions at the same time, the report says. Social pressures on the industry are rising, it notes, highlighting growing opposition to new infrastructure projects in certain areas and fracking bans. ""Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option."" Some companies have taken steps to address climate change, but the report says the industry as a whole could do more. The diverse industry requires a variety of approaches based on the particular circumstances of individual companies, according to the report, which was produced in co-operation with the World Economic Forum and will be presented at the organization's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday. The ""immediate task"" for the industry is to reduce its operational environmental footprint, Birol said. Approximately 15 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers, the report says. ""A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,"" said Birol. The most important and cost-effective measure would be to reduce methane leaks to the atmosphere, the report says. Other measures include integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into new upstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments. The report argues the industry and its resources and skills ""will be critical"" in helping some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies, like low-carbon hydrogen and biofuels, reach maturity. It says that scaling up such technologies and lowering their cost requires qualities the industry has, such as large-scale engineering and project management capabilities. ""Without the industry's input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,"" Birol said. On average, oil and gas companies invest about one per cent of their total capital spending in non-core areas — with the greatest amount in solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Leading companies spend about five per cent, according to the report, which says ""a much more significant change"" in capital spending allocation is needed to accelerate energy transitions. The energy sector can transform without the help of the oil and gas industry, the report reads, but that is a more difficult and expensive path. ""Regardless of which pathway the world follows, climate impacts will become more visible and severe over the coming years, increasing the pressure on all elements of society to find solutions. These solutions cannot be found within today's oil and gas paradigm.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-and-gas-industry-climate-change-international-energy-agency-1.5433475,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,[]
167,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-07T22:08:05.248Z,Medical device used during labour falls out of patient 10 weeks later,"As Laura Jokinen made her way home from a walk with her newborn son in October 2018, the shooting pain she'd been experiencing in her abdomen for weeks became unbearable. She limped home and buckled to the floor, screaming for her husband to help. ""It was at that point I reached down and felt a metal device protruding out of my vagina,"" said Jokinen, who works in health care as a risks assessment researcher. ""I freaked out … I didn't know what the device was or where it came from. It looked almost like a battery, and there were wires that were running up inside me. I was afraid to remove it, because I wasn't sure if it was attached to my insides."" The experience points to alarming statistics. Canada saw a major jump — 14 per cent over the last five years — in the number of medical items left inside patients after procedures, according to a study released Thursday by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), a not-for-profit group that collects data on the quality of health care in the country.  CIHI said 553 such objects were left inside patients over the last two years.  Canada has the highest rate among developed countries of medical items being left inside patients, according to a separate study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That means medical teams across the country need to do a better job of following existing safety procedures, according to Sandi Kossey, senior director of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI), a not-for-profit healthcare watchdog. ""There are checks and balances that should happen,"" said Kossey. ""There are enough preventative measures that should be in place, that these things should not happen."" Jokinen, who lives in Parksville, B.C., had to have an emergency caesarean section on Aug. 11, 2018, at the Nanaimo General Hospital. Before surgery, the medical team attached an electrode to the baby's head while he was still in the womb to monitor his heartbeat. Part of the monitor was removed during the C-section. But the medical team forgot to take out the rest.  Two weeks after Jokinen was discharged, she started having complications: an infection of her surgical incision and heavy, prolonged vaginal bleeding. Her doctors prescribed antibiotics but didn't detect what had been left inside her. It remained there for 10 weeks until it dislodged. Jokinen tried to find out, through the regional health authority, what the monitor was made of and how the mistake might have affected her health and that of her baby. ""At that point, he was two months old and I was breastfeeding, so I was really concerned about what risks this posed to his health,"" Jokinen said. Jokinen says she was on pins and needles for more than a month waiting to hear back. The response she finally got, she says, was less than helpful. The Vancouver Island Health Authority told her even the manufacturer couldn't say what the effect might be since the device was only designed and tested for use over periods of 24 hours or less. It said it looked at devices made of similar materials and didn't believe there were any long-term risks to Jokinen or her baby from the breakdown of the components.  Jokinen says she wanted the health authority to take responsibility, but it refused, saying the failure was by the surgeon who is an independent contractor and not an employee.  ""Physicians in B.C. are independent contractors who are licensed and regulated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C.,"" the authority said in an email to Go Public.  Jokinen said she was surprised by  the health authority's reaction. ""They're responsible for their subcontractor's actions and … providing safeguards to make sure that people aren't harmed."" Kossey, at the CPSI, agrees. ""Certainly, they are responsible for what happens under their watch and within their facility,"" she said.  Jokinen chose not to pursue action against the surgeon. Go Public reached out to HealthCareCAN, an organization that represents hospitals across Canada, for comment but did not immediately hear back.  According to the most recent report on the quality of healthcare in OECD countries, a foreign body — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — is left inside a patient in Canada 9.8 times out of every 100,000 surgeries. That's three times the average. The next-highest OECD results were Sweden at 8.3 followed by Netherlands with 4.6 per 100,000. ""The data shows that we're not doing as good as we should be as a developed country,"" Kossey told Go Public.  But she also suggests the reason Canada appears to have more mistakes could be in the accuracy of the reporting itself. ""Some of the other countries … being compared against may have different cultures around how they're collecting and using that information … it's a bit of a mixed signal,"" she said.  Kossey says medical teams need to ensure they do an appropriate inventory of equipment used during all procedures and to communicate clearly with the patient and family members — even in the most chaotic situations — what's being done so there are no surprises. Jokinen was surprised to hear how often something goes wrong. ""That points at a systemic flaw in our healthcare system,"" she said. ""In order to address that, we need to first acknowledge that it's happening. The health authorities need to take responsibility for the actions of their subcontractors and they also have to come up with a mitigation plan to avoid these types of events,"" she said.  The Vancouver Island Health Authority told Jokinen it has made changes. Non-surgical devices like the monitor that was left inside her were added to a checklist of items that need to be retrieved after medical procedures. ""We deeply regret that this patient had a poor care experience and we sincerely apologize to her,"" a spokesperson wrote in its email to Go Public.

168,Mike Blanchfield,2020-01-20T21:45:09.033Z,Canadian envoy Dominic Barton to testify at Canada-China parliamentary committee,"Canada's ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, will be among the first witnesses to testify before a new special parliamentary committee created to examine Canada's fraught relationship with China. The committee held its first meeting Monday, largely a planning session, and MPs from all parties agreed it was essential to hear from Barton, despite some minor differences of opinion on the timing. Eventually, they agreed he would testify before Feb. 7. Conservatives are pushing for an earlier appearance because Barton will be in Houston next Tuesday. Barton was a high-powered business consultant who was named in September to Canada's top diplomatic post in Beijing to help repair Canada's shredded diplomatic and economic relations with China. Opposition parties have flexed their collective muscles to push for answers from the new Liberal minority government as the Chinese imprisonment of two Canadians by the People's Republic enters its second year. The committee is the result of a Conservative motion passed in December that was supported by opposition parties in the minority Parliament. Conservative deputy leader Leona Alleslev said Barton told her in an email that he is ""ready and willing"" to testify. She said it was important that he testify first because he could help the committee understand the government's strategy towards China. ""It's such a critical witness,"" she told the committee. Alleslev said Barton could help the committee understand ""what the lay of the land is from Canada's man on the ground, as they say."" Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs, said government MPs on the committee realize the importance of Barton testifying, but he initially suggested that a briefing from officials at Global Affairs Canada would better set the table for MPs. ""We will operate in good faith,"" he told reporters before the meeting. ""We have Canadian lives at stake, and we're going to take that very seriously."" Thirteen months ago, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who remain imprisoned without access to lawyers or their families. The move has been widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the behest of the United States, which wants to extradite her on fraud charges related to U.S. sanctions against Iran. The motion that created the committee authorized it to order Barton, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to appear as witnesses ""from time to time as the committee sees fit."" Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O'Toole said in December the committee will work to address Canada's current diplomatic dispute with China and help develop a specialized approach to easing the bilateral challenges between the two nations. The all-party Canada-China relations committee convened Monday afternoon to deal mainly with a series of procedural issues, and the subject of Barton's testimony took up a good portion of the discussion. The meeting coincided with start of Meng's extradition hearing in Vancouver. Earlier Monday, China's foreign ministry reiterated its call for Canada to release Meng. ""The U.S. and Canada abused their bilateral extradition treaty and arbitrarily took compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without cause,"" said spokesman Geng Shuang, according to translated remarks on his ministry's website. ""This is entirely a serious political incident that grossly violates the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese citizen."" Meng is free on bail and living in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Monday that the well-being and release of Kovrig and Spavor is a ""clear priority"" for the Liberal government. ""That is at the heart of all the work we are doing and rightly so,"" she said in Winnipeg, where she was attending the Liberal cabinet retreat. Freeland also defended the Liberal government's handling of the Meng case. ""Our government has been clear that we are a rule of law country and that we honour our extradition treaty commitments,"" she said. ""That is what we need to do and that is what we will do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/special-canada-china-committee-1.5432960,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/laforge-cdc-feihe-board-appointment-1.5375209,/news/politics/laforge-cdc-feihe-board-appointment-1.5375209 /news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149 /news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460
169,Don Murray,2020-01-17T19:40:22.862Z,40 days of strikes show French fondness for revolution over reform,"Welcome to France. Huge public-sector strikes hobble the country's vaunted rail system, its ports, its refineries and public transport in Paris. Buses and trains barely ran over Christmas, hundreds of thousands of people struggled to get home or paid heavily for flights or make-shift car-share deals. The daily commute became the daily trudge, lasting hours for tens of thousands. The odd city bus trundling down the street resembled a human sardine can. All the while, the rest of Europe looks on, amazed. This is ""l'exception française,"" and the French are proud of it. Once, in May 1968, the whole country went on strike for a month. It was a revolt, a festival, a challenge to the established order. That mad month still resonates in the country. You merely have to look at the last 40 days in the streets of Paris and across France. And what is the burning issue that has brought tens of thousands of workers into the streets to demonstrate and strike? A debate about raising the retirement age, in a law not yet passed, and only projected to go into effect in seven years. The government of President Emmanuel Macron came to office proclaiming it would bring order to the country's 42 public pension schemes. Last year, it announced it wanted to raise the general retirement age from 62 to 64 to find more contribution money to help cover runaway pension costs. Government figures suggest the public sector pension deficit could soar to more than $25 billion Cdn by 2025. The government also wants to create a single points-based pension system for public sector pensions. Workers would accumulate pensions based on all years worked. It would be fairer, the government said. The big public sector unions howled in protest. This was an infringement of acquired rights, they said. The rail workers, in particular, have a very advantageous deal, negotiated in the 1950s, which allows many of them to retire on a full pension at 57. To outsiders, this confrontation seems puzzling, almost ludicrous. Just next door, the Germans have quietly raised the general retirement age from 65 to 67 as of the end of the decade, and are talking of raising it further to 69. There have been no strikes, no confrontations. To help understand the difference between France and its neighbours, consider the insight of a well-known French political thinker, Raymond Aron, who once said, ""the French, from time to time, organize revolutions, but never reforms."" Thus, May 1968. It was totally unexpected, coming in the middle of what the French called the ""30 glorious years"" — three decades of fast economic growth.  But unemployment was rising, particularly youth unemployment. And there was a feeling that society was frozen, with rigid, conservative elites clinging on at the top. Students started the strikes, and then almost everyone joined in. It wasn't quite a revolution – in the end, it didn't even topple the government. The French simply dubbed it ""the events of '68."" But ""the events"" became a template for future confrontations. In the past 25 years, the scenario has played out on half a dozen occasions.  Successive French governments have introduced vast reform plans — to education, the labour code, the pension system. In the 1990s, two French prime ministers had to abandon their plans after massive street demonstrations. One prime minister was chased from office. In the first 15 years of this century, two successive presidents tried again with labour and pension reforms. Both were forced into humiliating retreats, and both lost office after just one term. The thread running through these revolts was the belief that these were reforms imposed by remote, technocratic elites on people who had had little say in drawing them up. Add to that the belief that French MPs are little more than straw men and women with little influence or power, and you have a recurring recipe for confrontation in the streets. And success has bred success. Confrontation has often taken place in a sort of carnival atmosphere. As in previous strikes, I watched during the recent actions as crowds of strikers marched down a main boulevard that had been cordoned off by police. The marchers sang and let off smoke bombs. There were floats and small bands. Despite the problems caused by the strikes, those watching seemed remarkably unruffled, as if this was part of the price of being French. But things are changing. Under President Macron, there have been two massive public sector strikes. The first, against his labour reforms almost two years ago, lasted weeks and was a failure. The reforms went through. It became easier to hire and fire workers. The economy has picked up. Unemployment is dropping. The second strike, going on now, has seen Macron keep to the background, forcing his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to take the flak and make concessions to, among others, the police unions and — wait for it — the ballet workers. They will still be allowed to retire early. The prime minister may lose his job, but the reform is still on the table, and despite the closure of major ports this week, many trains are running again. The strikers are losing energy. That's because France has a dirty little labour secret. The unions represent only eight per cent of workers, according to European Union statistics, and almost all union members are in the public sector. Germany has double the number of unionized workers, Britain almost triple. While this long battle has taken place, people in the French private sector have quietly trudged to work almost every day. It's all a far cry from 1968, when unions represented almost 30 per cent of French workers and the French Communist Party pulled in 20 per cent of the votes. Now that party is just shards and ashes, as is the French socialist party. Strikers are slowly melting away, the unions are now split, but hard-line union leaders insist the battle will continue. More national days of protest are planned. Standing in front of the Bank of France, where tellers who count bills had just joined the strike, Jean-Marc Caron, a union leader with the CGT (General Confederation of Labour), said, ""we refuse this counter-reform.  It will lead to a drop in pensions for thousands of public servants."" The government doesn't deny this, but offers consultations to come up with a fair system. There are still fighting words in the streets, but this massive strike may be one of the last hurrahs for such union confrontations. Far different is the problem of the ""gilets jaunes,"" the yellow jackets movement that ambushed Macron in 2018. This was a spontaneous populist revolt, springing from the disaffection of poorer people around the country. Macron was able to blunt the ambush with a show of humility and large tax breaks, but he has not overcome the problem or won the trust of those people. That, however, is a confrontation for another day.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/40-days-of-strikes-show-french-fondness-for-revolution-over-reform-1.5430839,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-pensions-strike-1.5392670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/paris-pension-strikes-traffic-1.5389742,/news/world/france-pensions-strike-1.5392670 /news/world/paris-pension-strikes-traffic-1.5389742

171,Anonymous,2020-01-17T17:51:43.300Z,Eminem releases surprise album advocating for gun control,"Rapper Eminem has once again dropped a surprise album, releasing Music to Be Murdered By on Friday. The follow-up to 2018's Kamikaze — also released without warning — was announced on Twitter just after midnight.  The Detroit rapper also released a new music video for Darkness, one of the 20 tracks on the album, that depicts a shooting at a concert. The lyrics and storyline of the video specifically allude to the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival that left 58 people dead, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The video closes with audio and video footage of news broadcasts from other recent mass shooting around the U.S. as well as an appeal for viewers to register to vote and ""help change gun laws in America."" Warning: The following video contains graphic scenes of violence and strong language ""When will this end? When enough people care,"" reads the text. A link to the music video on Eminem's website encourages viewers to contact or visit several gun violence prevention organizations, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Sandy Hook Promise. The album's cover art features blood spatter and a bearded Eminem clad in a suit and fedora and holding a shovel. An alternate cover features the same splatter as well as a hatless Eminem holding both a hatchet and a gun to his head in an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 album of the same name.  ""Inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!"" Eminem posted via Twitter. Another track from the album, Unaccommodating, has sparked outrage for also touching on a recent tragedy. In a line from the song, the rapper references the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb attack, which killed 22 people outside a concert by American singer Ariana Grande. eminem stans are really trying to defend his joke about a terrorist attack that killed 22 people and gave ariana PTSD...literally bye If y’all are hyping up eminem after his line “i’m contemplating yelling bombs away on the game like i’m outside an ariana grande concert” please unfollow me that’s disgusting Some listeners labelled the line ""sick"" or ""disgusting."" Figen Murray, whose 29-year-old son Martyn Hett died in the attack, took to Twitter to describe the lyric as ""totally pointless"" and ""distasteful."" Ok, I just watched the 11 min clip. Feels like he is piggybacking on the fame of Ariana grande and Justin bieber and says distasteful things about other celebrities. Not clever. Totally pointless. And before all Eminem fans pounce on me, I am not interested and will not engage. <a href=""https://t.co/fE9MbepeqN"">https://t.co/fE9MbepeqN</a> Music to Be Murdered By is Eminem's 11th studio album, according to his website.

The body of Lochead, 36, was found in the basement of his home, next to an overturned table. His roommate told police he saw a man scurrying from the house after the discovery of the body. Police suspected foul play, began interviewing witnesses and brought that man in for questioning. But then came the autopsy. Calgary medical examiner Dr. Evan Matshes told the RCMP that contrary to what they might have thought, Lochead died from cardiac disease. And with no homicide, there was no crime to investigate. The RCMP broke the news to Lochead's widow, Sally Wheeler. ""I was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' I was so shocked that this is what [the RCMP] was telling me,"" she said in a recent interview with The Fifth Estate's Mark Kelley. Lochead's death is one of several cases that came under scrutiny in 2012. Alberta's Justice Ministry ordered a review of some of the autopsies done by a Calgary medical examiner after questions were raised about the accuracy of his findings. Documents obtained by The Fifth Estate reveal that Alberta Justice commissioned that review, which exposed several potential miscarriages of justice. Wheeler said the RCMP told her a few months after her husband died that the autopsy prevented them from laying charges. ""They mentioned that he had a blow to the head and a broken bone in his neck,"" she said. ""But they couldn't take it any further because it hadn't been ruled a homicide and I was like, 'What?'"" Turns out Wheeler wasn't the only one to question the autopsy results. Documents obtained recently by The Fifth Estate show that a second medical opinion from three expert forensic pathologists — written two years after Lochead died — differed from the original medical examiner's finding. They wrote that Lochead's death was more likely a homicide by ""strangulation."" Senior officials in the Alberta Justice Ministry received that report as part of a larger review of Matshes's autopsies, but the findings were buried in court files for several years until unearthed by The Fifth Estate. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Wheeler and roommate Jimmy Dean, who were both in the house the night of the death, say it was obvious to them from the beginning that Lochead was killed. The evening started with Lochead acting as a Good Samaritan. He had gone out to pick up refreshments for an evening poker game and came back with two strangers he met at the store. The strangers claimed their vehicle had broken down at the side of the road. Lochead, a friendly Maritimer and father of three whom Wheeler described as her ""angel,"" wanted to make sure the stranded travellers would not freeze in the frigid November night. Wheeler remembers the two men as Americans who spoke Russian. One of the men appears to have stayed late. Dean went to bed early and woke up just before 7 a.m. to discover the body. He said when he was on the phone to 911, he heard movement in another room. ""That's when I seen this fellow standing in the hallway,"" Dean told The Fifth Estate. ""I told him to stay and he opened the door and took off."" Dean and Wheeler said police later told them that the stranger from the hallway was hiding in an unlocked car down the road. The American was taken in for questioning and treated for injuries he claimed were sustained in a fight with Lochead. Dean said the RCMP told him some of what the American said in the police interrogation.   According to the suspect, a struggle began after Lochead began to have concerns about who the visitor really was. ""That's how the fight started because the guy didn't want to give Preston his ID,"" Dean said. Soon after the death, local news reports indicated that the RCMP were already getting signals from the medical examiner that it might not be ruled a homicide. ""Police are still awaiting Monday's autopsy results to determine if the struggle contributed to Lochead's death or if he died from natural causes afterward,"" the Calgary Herald reported. According to Wheeler, the RCMP told her the American was eventually allowed to return to the United States. Wheeler said the RCMP told her: ""We're keeping an eye on him and we're in touch with the police down there."" But months later, Wheeler said, the RCMP told her that the finalized autopsy report meant they could not lay charges. A later review of 14 of Matshes's medical files would include Lochead's autopsy. That review, commissioned by Alberta's Justice Ministry, stated that the medical examiner made unreasonable conclusions in 13 cases.  Airdrie RCMP told The Fifth Estate recently that Alberta Justice did not provide them with the 2012 report pointing to the death as a homicide. A major crimes investigator at the RCMP was assigned to check their old case file and did not find the report. ""There is no communication from Alberta Justice on this investigation,"" Airdrie RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Laurel Scott said in a recent email. In their peer review report to Alberta Justice, the expert medical pathologists wrote that more ""weight"" should have been given to ""strangulation"" as the cause of Lochead's death. ""A homicide manner [of death] is more appropriate,"" the three pathologists wrote in their November 2012 critique of Matshes's original autopsy. Wheeler is still confused about why nothing happened next. ""There was a fight, he's dead. It was so clear to me,"" Wheeler said. ""Why didn't they reopen the case?"" Eric Tolppanen, now head of Alberta Crown Prosecution Service and then a senior justice official, declined an interview with The Fifth Estate. In a statement, he did not answer directly whether the expert review panel document was provided to the RCMP in Airdrie. Tolppanen said that the RCMP were told that ""this police file would benefit from additional peer review."" He said that the RCMP acted on that advice and later ""sent the file to the Crown for review for possible charges."" Tolppanen said that Crown prosecutors determined there was ""no reasonable likelihood of conviction."" However, the RCMP appear to dispute that version of events.  The RCMP agree that in 2015 they discussed the case with the Crown prosecutor who did not support laying charges. However, the Mounties say they were not told about the expert peer review panel finding of a possible homicide. ""The RCMP is not aware of a formal review that was done on the [medical examiner's] autopsy report,"" Scott said in her email to The Fifth Estate. Wheeler points the finger directly at Alberta Justice for not acting more quickly back in 2012 when they learned the death may have been a homicide. ""Why did nothing happen?"" she said. ""Why did it just stop there? So they determine he was killed, but then say 'Oh, I guess that doesn't matter?' That's not right."" Wheeler is calling on Alberta Justice to provide the documents to the RCMP so that they can reopen their investigation. ""Why wasn't that guy brought back to Canada to face charges?"" she said. Matshes declined repeated requests for an interview with The Fifth Estate. In statements to the CBC, he said he stands by his work. In 2013, Alberta Justice agreed to set aside the report of the expert panel at his request. Matshes successfully argued he was not adequately consulted in the process and that the review was based on limited information. A judge signed off on that agreement in November 2013. In a brief to the Court of Queen's Bench in Alberta, the justice minister said it was ""integral to the administration of justice"" that they continue to investigate the accuracy of Matshes's work and promised to hold a second review panel. In a recent statement, Matshes said he was also cleared by an expert pathologist working for the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons in a related investigation. ""That expert reviewer, who was in possession of all of the evidence that I had at the time I certified the deaths, concluded that I met the standard of care in each case,"" he wrote. The Fifth Estate has also obtained records from that college review. A complaint was made to the college in 2012 about the appropriateness of Matshes's dissections during some autopsies. The college ruled that Matshes was permitted to make those dissections. The college forensic pathologist also concluded that homicide was a likely scenario in Lochead's death. The college expert, whose name was redacted in the report acquired by The Fifth Estate, stated that although cardiac disease may have been a factor in the death, the ruling should have been ""homicide,"" as the violent struggle precipitated any existing physical condition. ""If one determines that the cause of death was cardiac precipitated by the physical altercation, the manner becomes homicide,"" the college expert wrote. The college's forensic pathologist also noted ""evidence of blunt force injury"" and ""neck compression."" The college expert also contemplated the possibility of charges against the killer and noted that careful documentation of the injuries would be essential as the accused might try to argue self-defence. ""If charges were considered, a potential defence in this case would be self-defence. In such a case, documentation of all injuries to the deceased is essential,"" the college review wrote. Today, Wheeler wants Alberta Justice held accountable. ""I want somebody to apologize to his family and to me and for all the people that cared about him,"" she said. ""They just looked at this information and decided it wasn't enough, it wasn't important enough. Well, Preston was damn important to us.""

He was 95. The Tolkien Society and publisher HarperCollins UK confirmed Tolkien's death. The Centre Hospitalier de la Dracénie, a hospital in southern France, said the son of author J.R.R. Tolkien died there Thursday. HarperCollins is deeply saddened to have learnt of the passing of editor and author Christopher Tolkien, aged 95. <a href=""https://t.co/piDjo8iF2j"">https://t.co/piDjo8iF2j</a> <a href=""https://t.co/MdFh8hMwAs"">pic.twitter.com/MdFh8hMwAs</a> Tolkien's life work was closely identified with that of his father, J.R.R. Tolkien. The writer's youngest son, he helped edit and publish much of his father's writings after the science fiction and fantasy master died in 1973. Among the books he worked on were The Silmarillion, The Children Of Hurin, and other texts that flesh out the complex world his father created. He also drew the original maps that adorned the three Lord of the Rings books — The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King — when they were published in the 1950s. Christopher Tolkien has died at the age of 95. The Tolkien Society sends its deepest condolences to Baillie, Simon, Adam, Rachel and the whole Tolkien family. <a href=""https://t.co/X83PTx4b7x"">pic.twitter.com/X83PTx4b7x</a> Tolkien Society chairman Shaun Gunner said ""millions of people around the world will be forever grateful to Christopher for bringing us"" so many of his father's literary works. ""Christopher's commitment to his father's works have seen dozens of publications released, and his own work as an academic in Oxford demonstrates his ability and skill as a scholar,"" he said. ""We have lost a titan and he will be sorely missed."" J.R.R. Tolkien scholar Dimitra Fimi said Christopher Tolkien helped the public understand his father's works. ""Tolkien studies would never be what it is today without Christopher Tolkien's contribution,"" she said. ""From editing The Silmarillion to the mammoth task of giving us The History Of Middle-earth series, he revealed his father's grand vision of a rich and complex mythology.""

Levi Jacob Snow was born during the height of a raging blizzard that knocked out power and hit eastern Newfoundland so hard that the military has been called in. It was 10:41 p.m. on Friday, about the same time that a record was broken at St. John's International Airport for the highest snowfall amounts for a single day. ""He's a very happy and healthy baby. However, we knew there would be a mess in front of our house,"" said new dad Kyle Snow. He asked for help digging out their St. John's home on social media, and by Sunday, 10 to 15 people were outside the house with shovels. The couple faced 2.5-metre snow drifts. ""On the way here, I ran into a snowblower/plow operator and asked him ... well, I'd say I begged him to make a cut through the street,"" Kyle Snow said, which the driver did. Snow said he is floored by the kind response he received just by making a plea for help online. Luckily the couple made it to the Health Sciences Centre before the storm hit, around 3 a.m. Friday. ""When we got to the hospital, it started snowing,"" Snow said Sunday, as Good Samaritans shovelled outside his home. ""Every couple of hours I'd go out and have a look and the difference in those few hours was just incredible. The hospital was shaking and that's a pretty solid building."" Medical staff needed to know if the route home was safe before letting mom and baby out of hospital.

175,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:31:25.372Z,Lawyers argue whether Jenny McKay's diary should be evidence at husband's murder trial,"About two weeks before Jenny McKay was killed, she wrote, ""he said he was going to make my life a living hell and bury me the way I buried him.""   Crown prosecutor Adam Breker said Jenny wrote that in her diary — allegedly detailing a threat made by her husband Jason — on Aug. 23, 2017. Jason, 47, has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Jenny to death about two weeks later. He's on trial by judge alone at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench.  Earlier in the trial, a forensic pathologist testified that Jenny died from stab and cut wounds to the neck which caused excessive blood loss. He said she was stabbed numerous times both before and after her she died.  Jenny's journal is one piece of evidence that has been presented as part of a voir dire, a trial within a trial. Breker and defence lawyer Thomas Hynes made submissions Monday, advocating for what evidence should — or should not — be applicable during the trial proper. Breker said Jenny's journal entry gave insight into the McKay couples' relationship. He also highlighted testimony from McKay's daughters, colleagues and police officers, along with a 911 call made by Jenny on Aug. 27, 2019, and an in-police-car recording of Jason. The evidence, he said, demonstrated that Jenny ""had a fear of the accused."" He noted that evidence showed Jenny was trying to leave her situation, but Jason ""begged her"" to come home. ""She was telling him that she would not do so and needed to be away,"" Breker said.  He spoke to evidence that suggested past abuse, including two witnesses who testified that Jason had hit Jenny.  Breker said Jenny's state of mind and the nature of the relationship between an accused and the deceased are commonly presented as evidence in domestic homicides. He suggested the fact that this was a judge-alone trial favoured the inclusion of said evidence. Defence lawyer Thomas Hynes raised questions about Jenny's diary and text messages, calling her an ""unreliable narrator"" who could not be cross-examined. He said Jenny could have misperceived, exaggerated, or ""misremembered"" situations or encounters with Jason because of alcohol consumption. Hynes pointed to an alleged alcohol addiction as the driving force behind her behaviour. He questioned if Jenny wanted to leave the McKay home because she was afraid, or if it was because the two enabled each other to drink. Hynes questioned whether Jenny was forming an escape plan to leave an abusive relationship or if she was trying to ""sober up.""  ""Was Jason McKay abusive as indicated, or was it just drunk misinterpretation?"" Hynes asked. Breker argued against Hynes' suggestion that what Jenny said or wrote were ""misperceptions."" He said the Crown had presented direct evidence that corroborated Jenny's accounts. Justice Michael Tochor reserved his decision on what will be admissible to the trial for Wednesday morning. After that, Hynes is expected to let the court know if the defence will call any evidence of its own. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-week-second-degree-murder-1.5433136,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074,/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288 /news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 /news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074
176,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-08T13:00:00.380Z,The RCMP said it didn't have any records about an investigation. But it had thousands.,"The RCMP is apologizing for saying it didn't have any records about its 11-month investigation into the death of Michel Vienneau, who was shot by a Bathurst Police Force member in 2015. In fact, the police agency had more than 10,000 records about the Nova Scotia RCMP's investigation into Vienneau's death, which led to criminal charges against two Bathurst Police Force officers. The charges were dropped in 2017 after a preliminary inquiry. More than two years after CBC News asked for the records through an access to information request, and more than four years after Vienneau's death, the RCMP disclosed nearly 1,800 pages of documents and more than 1,000 images and videos related to the investigation. That came only after an investigation by the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada. The RCMP blamed human error, saying the search for records wasn't done properly. ""Although in the end it is clear that we did not meet our obligations, this appears to be a process failure, not the result of any ill-intent,"" Dan Brien, the RCMP's director of issues management and media relations, wrote in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""I am not aware of any intent to hide or suppress information on the part of RCMP personnel."" No one from the RCMP was made available for an interview. Minutes after Vienneau was shot outside Bathurst's Via Rail station on the morning of Jan. 12, 2015, Nova Scotia RCMP officers were called in to investigate. New Brunswick doesn't have its own serious incident response team like neighbouring Nova Scotia. Instead, police agencies from other jurisdictions are often tasked with investigating police-involved shootings or deaths. In this case, the two subject officers were employed by the Bathurst Police Force but worked in the now-disbanded Northeast Integrated Intelligence Unit. The unit, made up of officers from several police forces in the area, including RCMP, focused on gathering intelligence about drugs and organized crime. Vienneau appeared on the officers' radar that day when their supervisor, RCMP Sgt. Ron DeSilva, now an inspector, received Crime Stoppers tips that Vienneau was returning from Montreal with a load of drugs. The tips were false. For months, a team of Nova Scotia RCMP officers pieced together what led to the shooting. They interviewed about 100 witnesses. Lead investigator Larry Wilson described the investigation as ""complex"" and ""exhaustive"" in an email he sent to his team after the investigation concluded. ""The fact that the subjects of this case are police officers added another layer of complexity but each and everyone of you brought an unbiased and professional approach to your tasks,"" Wilson wrote. But when CBC News asked for all records about the Nova Scotia RCMP investigation into Vienneau's death, the RCMP had a surprising response. ""Based on the information provided, a search for records was conducted in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,"" Insp. Richard Haye of the RCMP's access to information and privacy branch wrote in a May 2017 letter. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to locate records which respond to your request.""  How is it possible that a division of Canada's largest police force could spend months on a complex investigation into a man's death but not have any records about the investigation? It wasn't possible because it wasn't true. The original request, filed in February 2017, also asked for records that detailed the process of sending the file to the Crown, which has to approve criminal charges in New Brunswick, and about the false Crime Stoppers tips that led police to Vienneau on the day of his death. CBC News filed a complaint about the request in June 2017, suggesting it was inconceivable the RCMP wouldn't have records about a lengthy investigation. ""We posed numerous questions regarding the institution's processing of your request and the nature of their search for the records requested,"" the investigation report from the commissioner's office says. ""A second tasking was conducted and the RCMP located relevant records which were then reviewed to determine which documents could be released.""  An investigator with the Office of the Information Commissioner was tasked with reviewing the records, combing through nine CDs. One CD had thousands of written records on 6,645 pages. There were also more than 3,500 photos, videos or audio records that were reviewed, according to correspondence sent to CBC News. Some of those records ultimately weren't disclosed, for a variety of reasons. Some were duplicates. The final package didn't include any video recordings of what unfolded that day outside Bathurst's Via Rail station. According to the Nova Scotia RCMP's report on the shooting, no such video exists. While the commissioner's investigation prompted the RCMP to disclose records it previously said it didn't have, it doesn't explain what went wrong in the first place. That's problematic for Ken Rubin, an Ottawa-based investigator and researcher who has spent decades using Canada's freedom of information system to draw out information that's in the public interest. ""I think they have to be held more accountable,"" Rubin said about the commissioner's office. ""You can't just go from no records to 10,000 and say, 'Oh, aren't we wonderful. We got the records for you.' No, what happened? Come on.""  In its explanation, the RCMP said it relies on people to search its records. ""In addition to our ongoing challenges related to the scope and volume of incoming requests, we occasionally encounter situations where individual searches do not identify all the documents that they should,"" Brien wrote in an email. ""In this case, through the Information Commissioner's investigation, we discovered that, for a variety of reasons, the document search was not executed properly."" He said not all of the units that should have been asked to search were asked to do so. Others who were searching found no records, which wasn't accurate. ""This situation has provided us with valuable insight into gaps in our system and we will continue to take every opportunity to improve our processes."" Rubin sees the case as part of a larger problem with the RCMP's access to information system. Last year, the RCMP was wading through a backlog of unanswered requests, prompting the police force to reverse a policy that forced members to go through access to information to get their own medical or personnel files. RCMP backlogged with access-to-information requests from its own staff Earlier this year, an access to information officer emailed CBC News to ask whether the requester still wanted overdue records from 2017, noting the RCMP is ""experiencing a high volume of requests with limited resources."" ""It's common knowledge that the RCMP, at least in terms of access to information, has not been that well organized or forthcoming in the last few years and has huge delays and some other problems … they are not the top of the transparency bureaucracy,"" Rubin said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/vienneau-rcmp-foi-1.5387196,[],/news/canada/new-brunswick/michel-vienneau-family-reward-crime-stoppers-tips-1.5378238 /news/canada/new-brunswick/bathurst-arbitration-hearing-shooting-police-michel-vienneau-1.5367649 /news/canada/new-brunswick/bathurst-arbitration-hearing-day-9-officer-1.5346299 /news/canada/new-brunswick/bathurst-shooting-hearing-decision-1.5337736
177,Veronica Sheppard,2019-12-22T09:00:00.675Z,The phantom menace: When Baby Yoda memes go bad,"This column is an opinion by Veronica Sheppard, a writer and marketing manager based in Toronto specializing in human-driven stories about culture, food and media. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. ""You're telling me you're the only person on the internet who doesn't find Baby Yoda cute?"" This is a conversation I had with my brother on our way to dinner recently. I had told him, much to his dismay, that this was the case. My feed had been inundated with the same four memes from dozens of accounts, each one feeling more like a discount Disney billboard than the last. ""And it's working for them,"" he said. In theory, he's right. The robed, big-eyed creature deemed Baby Yoda from Disney's new series The Mandalorian, based in the Star Wars universe, has dominated online pop culture recently: memes, articles and even fan tattoos have sprung up in a matter of weeks. From a bird's-eye view, it's another successful wave of meme marketing. But my grievance extends beyond the repetitiveness of the content; it's with the unmeasurable risks companies are taking by handing over their brands to unknown creators. From a marketing perspective, it's smart at the surface level. It's no coincidence that Baby Yoda's popularity is spiking during a monumental time for the brand. Disney+ is in its infancy and has been highly anticipated as a contender in the streaming world, a new Star Wars movie is in theatres, and the holidays are a busy time for merchandise sales. Given the success of meme marketing as a tactic late last year with Netflix's Bird Box, Disney recognized that a few well-positioned still frames of their beloved new character could get them the extra attention needed to get subscriber numbers up. What they might not have considered is the damage being done to the integrity of their brand. Handing over the reins of a valuable pop-culture asset to a community of random creators is a double-edged sword. It endangers loyalty with existing fans by potentially cheapening the Star Wars name, and begins to turn off people who feel oversaturated by the character. The cracks have already begun to show in Disney's marketing method — they opened the floodgates and are now at the mercy of Instagrammers everywhere, and they should hope that they can regain control soon. The danger extends beyond Instagram's already massive reach of more than 1 billion daily active users. It's true. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheMandalorian?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TheMandalorian</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BabyYoda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#BabyYoda</a> <a href=""https://t.co/yA25RpIrjK"">pic.twitter.com/yA25RpIrjK</a> Many brands have fallen victim to bandwagoning on platforms they aren't equipped to own conversations on. Improper attempts to appeal to younger demographics through memes and slang have become so regular, it even spawned its own community on Reddit called r/FellowKids, where users publicly shame brands and their social media managers' poor attempts to stay relevant. It's this kind of tone deafness that puts so many brands on the defensive. Just this year, Sunny D was under fire for turning depression into a ""cute brand joke,"" as one Twitter user put it, and Chase Bank caught major backlash for seemingly turning a blind eye to poverty. .<a href=""https://twitter.com/Chase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Chase</a>: why aren’t customers saving money?<br>Taxpayers: we lost our jobs/homes/savings but gave you a $25b bailout<br>Workers: employers don’t pay living wages<br>Economists: rising costs + stagnant wages = 0 savings<br>Chase: guess we’ll never know<br>Everyone: seriously?<br> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MoneyMotivation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#MoneyMotivation</a> <a href=""https://t.co/WcboMr5MCE"">pic.twitter.com/WcboMr5MCE</a> Now beloved Baby Yoda is hitting the wrong nerve with some audiences, coming off as a tacky spin-off and showing up in a slew of NSFW (not safe for work) memes. Attempting to go viral through social marketing is nothing new, but as more competitors join the streaming wars, I expect Instagram feeds will increasingly be laden with lazy, monotonous content from the big brands. Apple, Hulu, HBO and other streaming goliaths are set to collectively spend dozens of billions on content development in 2020 alone, all of which will be aimed at similar audiences. I can only imagine that as the space becomes more crowded, we'll be inundated with quick, cookie-cutter content designed with memes in mind. But at what cost?

The 37th edition of the Fête des neiges de Montréal will feature a plethora of activities that rely on snow and cold weather — from tubing to skating and ice carving. The event is taking place at Espace 67 on Île Sainte-Hélène, just a few minutes' walk from Parc Jean-Drapeau Metro station. ""The view of Montreal is absolutely fantastic,"" said ​​Kav​​en Gauthier, a spokesperson for the event. He said new this year is a loop that allows people to skate alongside the river and look out over the St. Lawrence River. The 300-metre path takes visitors through forest and along the shoreline in a big circle, he said. Another source of excitement, Gauthier said, is the ""big comeback of the tube-sliding lanes."" He said this year there are 16 lanes for tube sliding, an activity he called ""absolutely out of this world."" While some of the old mainstays of the winter festival are gone — namely the zipline and dogsled rides — other activities have taken their place. Along with ice-sculpting demonstrations by Nicolas Godon three times a day, there will also be a brand new circus performance on four stages. Acrobats from Cirque Éloize will be putting on a show with a theme of mountain climbing twice daily, at 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. The opening weekend of the Fête des neiges will be a wintry one: Montreal will see some snow, with a high of around –13 C. Environment Canada says it will feel like -25 with the wind chill. There will be more snow overnight Saturday, and Sunday will be a little warmer, with a high of –8 C. Visitors will have to buy a pass to access the site, but it's valid for all eight days of the event, which runs four consecutive weekends, from Jan. 18 to Feb. 9. According to the festival's website, visitors are allowed to bring their own food onto the site, and food and drink (including beer and mulled wine) will also be available for sale. Winter enthusiasts are also allowed to bring their own skates and snowshoes, but for tubing, they are required to use the tubes the event organizers provide. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/f-te-des-neiges-2020-1.5430781,[],/news/canada/montreal/plateau-mont-royal-bike-paths-snow-clearing-1.5403685 /news/canada/montreal/cavalia-illumi-laval-1.5410473

180,Laura Glowacki,2020-01-20T15:41:30.068Z,English public elementary schools close today for teachers' strike,"Classes are cancelled Monday for all elementary students at Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) schools. It's the first wave of rotating one-day strikes by the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO). Elementary teachers are walking out Jan. 20 in three large Ontario school boards: Toronto, York Region, and the OCDSB. ""We feel that we have no option at this time, based on the fact that this government has not engaged in meaningful negotiations for over four months,"" said ETFO president Sam Hammond Friday. Along with the closure of elementary schools in Ottawa, Grade 7 and 8 classes at Bell, Earl of March, Longfields-Davidson Heights, Merivale and Sir Robert Borden High Schools are also cancelled Monday, OCDSB said. Ontario's Education Minister Stephen Lecce has called the one-day strike ""unacceptable."" ""The immense uptake of our Support for Parents Initiative speaks volumes to the level of uncertainty union-led strike action causes,"" Lecce said in an email to CBC. The government's initiative provides payments to parents with children 12 years old or younger — or up to 21 years old, if they have special needs — to help with childcare. ""I will continue to focus on reaching voluntary agreements with the teachers' unions, so Ontario students stay in class where they belong,"" said Lecce. Monday is the third time in recent months OCDSB elementary schools have closed. Schools closed previously on Jan. 15 and Dec. 4 when elementary school staff — including early childhood educators —  belonging to the Ontario Secondary Schools Teachers' Federation, a different union, walked off the job. One of the main sticking points between ETFO and the province is support in the classroom, said Hammond. Teachers need more help with special needs students, like those on the autism spectrum, as well as children learning English, he said.  ""The supports and resources for those students are desperately needed in our schools and classrooms across this province, and this government has yet to enter into meaningful discussions around renewing those funds and those supports,"" he said.  Teachers also want the province to commit to all-day kindergarten and restore Regulation 274, which gives occasional teachers with more seniority an edge in hiring decisions.  When asked about the province's position Regulation 274, a spokesperson for Lecce said the ministry has a media blackout with the union. ""As such, we will not discuss what may or may not be happening at the bargaining table,"" they said in an email.  Teachers are also looking for a wage increase in line with inflation or the rising cost of living, Hammond said. That could be anywhere from 1.8 per cent to two per cent, he said. The province is offering a wage increase of one per cent, said Hammond. The province also declined to comment on the wage offer, citing the blackout.  ETFO is slated to continue its rotating strikes Tuesday when teachers in Renfrew County, as well as elsewhere in the province, walk off the job.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/etfo-monday-strike-ottawa-1.5431949,[],/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940 /news/canada/ottawa/etfo-osstf-oecta-school-strikes-1.5428455 /news/canada/toronto/etfo-public-teachers-strike-1.5427368 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-ford-unions-what-need-know-1.5429092 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-labour-action-1.5425586

182,Bridgette Watson,2020-01-17T09:00:00.220Z,Vancouver's drug-dispensing machine: Why it exists and how it works,"Health advocates say a safe supply of opioids is critical to help prevent people from overdosing on tainted street drugs.  Now, a pilot project in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside provides some high-risk users with access to an automated machine that dispenses opioids prescribed by a doctor. CBC takes a look at how it works. The machine, called MySafe, is stocked with hydromorphone tablets that are released on a pre-determined schedule to high-risk opioid users. A user must scan their palm on the machine to identify themselves. The machine recognizes each individual by verifying the vein pattern in their hand and then dispenses their prescription. Made of steel and bolted to the floor, MySafe resembles an ATM or vending machine. It logs every package that is released and sends that information to a web feed that only program administrators can access. Thousands of Canadians have lost their lives to the opioid crisis. In British Columbia, close to 5,000 people have died from overdoses since the province declared a public health emergency in 2016. A toxic drug supply, often contaminated by a powerful opioid called fentanyl, is responsible for at least 80 per cent of overdose deaths in B.C. in the past three years, according to the province's coroners service. ""I think the only ethical response in this situation is to at least give people an alternative of a safe pharmaceutical drug that they will not overdose on,"" said MySafe founder and infectious disease doctor Mark Tyndall. Tyndall says unlike methadone treatment, which is considered an abstinence-based program and helps addicts only with cravings and withdrawal symptoms, prescribed hydromorphone still gives users a high without the risk of death. Participants are opioid users who have a history of overdosing. They must undergo a medical evaluation before being prescribed hydromorphone and agree to regular followups with a health professional. During the pre-screening, a prospective participant must have fentanyl detected in their urine to be eligible. MySafe is located next to an overdose prevention site and participants can use the drugs there in the presence of health-care and front-line workers. The machine can supply enough pills for 48 users, holding five days worth of drugs for each participant, all of whom have their own specific prescriptions. Participants can use the machine up to four times a day, but they must wait a few hours between each use. The machine can be programmed to make the window between doses as long or as short as administrators want. The drugs are prescribed by a doctor and pre-packaged by a pharmacy. The pharmacy delivers the hydromorphone to designated health professionals who have been authorized by the participants to receive their prescriptions. Currently, Tyndall and a small group of volunteers run the pilot program and have this authorization. They load the machine. The sale, production and distribution of drugs is governed by the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. People can apply for exemptions from Health Canada. However, according to Health Canada, the machine does not require an exemption because it falls within the authority of health-care practitioners under provincial regulation, as the hydromorphone is prescribed to participants. The B.C. Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, which is not involved with MySafe, said it ""will await the results"" of the pilot and remains focused on its own work to scale up access to prescription alternatives to toxic street drugs. Perry Kendall, interim co-executive director of the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, supports the pilot project. ""We very much hope that this can be expanded to reduce deaths and morbidity, get people into treatment and eventually move people into recovery,"" said Kendall. Kendall, also a former provincial health officer, said the primary concern about the machine is the dispensed drugs will end up on the street, something Tyndall says is still a better alternative than having users take illegal drugs.  Derick Walker, a program participant, said the machine has given him his life back. ""I don't have to hustle all day to get money to support myself for street fentanyl, which is gambling with my life.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-drug-dispensing-machine-opioids-overdoses-1.5429704,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/safe-supply-insite-1.5274453 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-od-crisis-lives-saved-1.5163581 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/we-don-t-have-a-choice-experts-call-for-the-decriminalization-and-safe-supply-of-drugs-1.5271742 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/opioid-crisis-1.5215690 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-crisis-vancouver-election-1.5284444,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/no-phone-bill-telus-5000-1.5428591 /news/canada/british-columbia/bmo-indigenous-advisory-council-created-after-grandfather-12-year-old-handcuffed-at-brach-1.5429347 /news/politics/supreme-court-bc-reference-trans-mountain-1.5429423
183,Garrett Barry,2019-11-04T15:41:35.372Z,RCMP probing Bunyan's Cove finances after complaint from new committee,"The RCMP have launched an investigation into past financial practices at the Bunyan's Cove local service district, following the dissolution of the former committee and a complaint by the new committee's members. Representatives from the new committee say they filed a complaint with the police in late September, the same day they got access to the local service district's bank account. The financial situation means the community's dream of purchasing a new fire truck is now in doubt, and it will have to continue to rely on a vehicle that is nearly a half-century old. ""We had a public meeting when we found out the money was missing, and we had grown men and women here with tears in their eyes,"" said new local service committee chair Annie Perry. In interviews with CBC News, some current and past representatives are raising questions about the community's financial situation. Perry said she believes thousands of dollars is missing from the district's bank account, and she's seen cheques that she believes were written inappropriately before her term began. Perry took her position with the new district committee on Sept. 16, after the Department of Municipal Affairs called for a public meeting and dissolved the former committee. She said there is evidence of unexplained spending between 2017 and 2018. ""There's big amounts of money being written out,"" she said in an interview. ""For a little community, where did all this money go?"" David Squibb, another new member of the local service district committee, and Ruby Nicholson, the committee's new treasurer, also spoke to CBC News. Each said they believed money may have been inappropriately spent. The new seven-member committee is split, with some other members condemning Perry's choice to speak publicly about the community's finances while a police investigation is underway. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Department of Municipal Affairs said it was aware of the complaint to police, which it described as ""possible financial irregularities,"" and was planning a financial audit. The three new representatives told CBC News that thousands of dollars in funding that was earmarked for the purchase of a new fire truck for the Bunyan's Cove Fire Department appears to be gone from the community's bank account. Correspondence between governments show that in 2018, the Department of Municipal Affairs sent $248,131 to the local service district under its fire protection vehicles infrastructure program.  The district and the fire department were expected to raise another $62,034, and borrow even more to cover the HST and GST portion of the purchase. But the purchase of the fire truck was never completed — the truck remains in storage in Clarenville — and as of Sept. 20, the local service district had only $223,919 in its account. ""There's no money there that we're allowed to touch, because the $223,000 is not ours to spend,"" said Perry.   ""And if we don't get this new fire truck that's sitting in Clarenville, that money got to go back to the government."" Nicholson said the local service district has collected another $10,000, as residents have been paying their yearly fees. But the committee has also been stuck with overdue bills that must be paid — and they are not quite sure if more are coming. Perry said the local service district owes three months of bills to the garbage collector and the power company. CBC News obtained financial documents, including photocopies of cheques and partial bank statements for the Bunyan's Cove LSD account at CIBC. The documentation includes photocopies of 12 cheques that were written to Stephanie Chatman, a former member of the local service district committee, and two businesses that are linked to her: Chatman's Convenience and Chatman's Welding. Altogether, the cheques total a combined $96,598. The cheques were written between April 2017 and July 2018, and each cheque shows two signatures. Eleven of the 12 cheques have no information on the memo field that would indicate what the payment was for. The biggest payment, for $32,693, went to Chatman's Welding and was dated July 26, 2018. On Aug. 31, Stephanie Chatman, trading as Chatman's Welding, wrote a $100,000 cheque to the local service district. That cheque was deposited on Sept. 16 — the same day that the provincial government dissolved the former local service district committee. Chatman was one of two remaining members on the committee that was being dissolved. A full committee has seven members, but over the course of 2017 and 2018 committee members had resigned, and the committee was down to two this summer. There were several attempts to hold public meetings to elect new members, but those meetings never attracted enough residents from the community. Stephanie Chatman did not respond to several interview requests from CBC News. Eleven of the 12 cheques written to Chatman or her companies show what appear to be the signatures of two former LSD members — Chelsea Keats and Wade Bowring. When CBC News contacted Keats for comment, Clarenville lawyer James Hughes replied. Hughes wrote that his client was anticipating a call from the RCMP's investigating officer to give a statement as a potential witness. ""The signatures on the cheques purporting to be Ms. Keats's were forged and during that time period when the cheques were written, Ms. Keats was not part of the committee,"" Hughes wrote. Hughes wrote that he advised his client to only speak with police. Meanwhile, Wade Bowring — whose signature also appears to be on 11 of those 12 cheques — declined to comment about financial practices during his term on the committee, or why his signature appeared to be on those cheques. A local service district member said Bowring has told them that he did not sign inappropriate cheques. Reginald Perry was one of only two members who remained active on the local service district before it was dissolved Sept. 16. The other was Stephanie Chatman. Perry said his three years on the committee were ""terrible"" and he ""didn't know anything that was going on."" Perry told CBC News that he spent the majority of his term fighting for access to financial documents, which he said Chatman held.  He alleged his consistent requests were ignored, and also said he wrote to the Department of Municipal Affairs to ask it to launch an investigation. Other former committee members could not be reached by CBC News, or declined comment. Ruby Nicholson, the committee's new treasurer, said there are discrepancies between receipts provided to homeowners paying their fees, and money that was deposited into the CIBC account. ""From the receipts that I had, there was like $53,000 and change for receipts that people paid for their fees, and the deposit book only shows $27,000 and change,"" she said. The Bunyan's Cove local service district is responsible for providing water service, garbage collection and fire protection for the households in the community. Squibb, who volunteered with the fire department before starting with the local service district committee last month, said there are now questions about how the community will pay for a new fire truck. The new truck would replace a 1971 Ford 750. ""Right now, the old fire truck that we've got there, it leaks water. So every so often, you've got to go fill the tank up, top the tank up,"" Squbb said. ""Two years ago, we had a breakdown with one of the brakes.… We had to order to the States to get parts, because nobody has it anymore."" The fire department raised its own money for the truck, which Squibb says remains in the department's own bank account.  But because other money appears to be missing, the truck remains parked in Clarenville.

185,Peter Zimonjic,2020-01-16T23:58:52.114Z,Manning Centre to change its name as founder Preston Manning announces retirement,"Former Reform Party leader Preston Manning has announced his retirement from the political think tank and advocacy group that bears his name. It won't have his name for much longer: the Manning Centre for Building Democracy has announced a rebranding effort for the the organization and the high-profile conferences it organizes. Manning Centre president Troy Lanigan told CBC News that the 78-year-old former MP, who founded the organization in 2005, is leaving the centre behind so he can spend more time with his family. Lanigan said the centre is changing its name because Manning himself believes that will leave it free to chart its own course. ""He feels too many things are named after politicians and doesn't feel he needs that legacy,"" said Lanigan. ""Its legacy is its mission."" Lanigan said the centre will continue to pursue the mission that Manning set out to accomplish, which he described as ""breaking down silos and getting conservatives to work together and work strategically to create opportunities for success.""  CBC News has been unable to reach Manning, who is vacationing in Australia. Former Reform MP and Conservative cabinet minister Chuck Strahl told CBC News that before the Manning Centre came along, conservatives from different provincial parties seldom met with their federal counterparts, or each other, to exchange ideas and propose policy initiatives. ""It's kind of easy to forget that there wasn't a networking opportunity for what Preston always called the 'conservative movement,' as opposed to political parties,"" Strahl said. ""Preston is of the opinion that the conservative movement benefits from getting together, in all of its facets, and without having the party hierarchy managing it or overlooking it. This was the best way to get the best conservative ideas."" Manning will step back from the centre's work over the coming year, said Lanigan, adding that Manning himself will address his decision during the promotional tour for his coming book. The centre has launched a survey to solicit supporters for ideas for a new name. Strahl said that, no matter what name it ends up with, he hopes the centre will continue to provide a venue where conservative ideas can be discussed and debated. ""It's a better idea to get together and talk about things in a safe place rather than wait until there's a crisis of some sort,"" he said. ""It doesn't always come off perfectly but at least there's a place to do it. And I think there will be, regardless of what name it's given going forward."" Manning was the founder and sole leader of the Reform Party, which later became the Canadian Alliance before merging with the Progressive Conservatives to form the current Conservative Party of Canada. Manning served as the MP for Calgary Southwest from 1993 until 2002, and as leader of the Official Opposition from 1997 to 2000. Manning started the Manning Centre after leaving the House of Commons. The centre organizes the annual Manning Networking Conference, now entering its 12th year. The Manning Centre has made donations to registered third parties such as Canada Strong and Proud, which was linked to a number of robocalls and text messages sent out in June asking Canadians about their voting intentions and their position on pipelines. Some complained that they received the calls without having given permission for political advocacy groups to contact them. The group got at least $240,000 from the Manning Centre during the last federal election campaign for a series of anti-Trudeau and anti-Liberal campaign ads. The Manning Centre also gave $4,500 to Newfoundland and Labrador Strong and another $11,200 to Nova Scotia Strong, according to Elections Canada.

At least two other people were taken into custody while on the picket lines, including regional union director Gavin McGarrigle.  Blockades set up at the Co-op Refinery in Regina by Unifor members were being removed by tow trucks on Monday evening. The arrests began when a crowd stood near a U-Haul, preventing its towing. It's unclear if charges have or will be laid. The union blocked at least six entrances to the refinery as the latest action in an escalating labour dispute.  Dias, Unifor national president, had said at a media conference Monday morning that the blockades were set up by members of other Unifor locals. He argued that the action therefore did not violate a court injunction barring members of Unifor 594 — which represents workers at the refinery — from blocking access to the facility.  ""We'll deal with that in court because our argument today is that we are not violating any injunction at all,"" he said.  Monday marked 46 days since Unifor members were locked out. Later on Monday, once the blockades were being deconstructed, Dias used Twitter to accuse the Regina Police Service of picking sides, and put a call out for more Unifor members to travel to Regina in solidarity. We need thousands more <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unifor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Unifor</a> members to come to Regina because <a href=""https://twitter.com/reginapolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@reginapolice</a> have decided to side with <a href=""https://twitter.com/CoopFCL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CoopFCL</a> <a href=""https://t.co/IJPjqGp6BV"">https://t.co/IJPjqGp6BV</a> Officers on the scene told picketers that the blockades would be removed and that if there was any interference with the duties of workers removing the vehicles, there could be arrests made. The contract dispute mainly comes down to pensions. A previous deal included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan.  The union says this amounts to taking away workers' pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive.  ""We are going to guarantee you that not one fuel truck is going to leave this facility. From now on we're not going anywhere,"" Scott Doherty, Unifor's lead negotiator and executive assistant to the president, said. The refinery said in a statement that the blockades were illegal and that it is exploring legal options.  ""Unifor continues to use illegal blockades as a bullying tactic and has brought in extra people to help them to it,"" the statement said. ""Today's actions by Unifor represent yet another violation of the court injunction."" Regina police said they were monitoring the situation. In a statement, police said they were communicating with both sides to keep the peace and advising motorists to avoid the area of Ninth Avenue N., MacDonald Street and Fleet Street.  Dias estimated that about 500 people were brought in from across Canada to Regina and more are expected. Dias said the union also plans to increase the boycott of Co-ops across Western Canada if a deal isn't made.  ""Clearly the only place that this dispute will be resolved will be at the bargaining table,"" Dias said.  The refinery previously said Unifor hasn't returned to the bargaining table since September 2019.  A video showing a large flare at the Co-op Refinery on Saturday has been circulating on social media.  The refinery said in a statement that the facility momentarily lost power from SaskPower. As a result, some units came down at the same time. ""The flare system did the job it is designed to do in that situation. Power was restored within a minute of the incident, and our highly skilled management team brought the refinery units back online per normal operating procedures,"" the refinery said in a statement. ""Power failures happen occasionally, and our team is always prepared for an emergent scenario such as this."" Dias said flare-ups happen when replacement workers without proper experience are running a plant.  ""We're hoping that the safety concerns are being addressed,"" Dias said. ""We're hoping that the facility is just being taken care of properly, from a maintenance point of view. But ultimately we're not in control of that today. We wish we were but we are not.""

188,Anonymous,2020-01-20T02:07:53.397Z,Remembering Ryder: Northern Manitobans hang hockey jerseys for boy lost to cancer,"House by house, the jerseys seemed to appear overnight. They were hung in front windows and on porches in memory of a nine-year-old hockey player who died of a brain tumour on Friday. For people in The Pas, Man., and on the nearby Opaskwayak Cree Nation, the massive show of support was a reminder of how Ryder Armstrong united the two communities in the year he spent battling an unrelenting, high-grade glioma. ""It's amazing how everybody just comes together if someone needs help or someone needs some support,"" said Deann MacInnis, a close friend of Ryder's parents, Lissa Whitehead and Bryan Armstrong. The Manitoba communities are located about one kilometre away from each other, one on each side of the Saskatchewan River, and 521 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg. Ryder's diagnosis last January sent shock waves through the northern communities, his former hockey coach Jerome Conaty said. With a mother from Opaskwayak Cree Nation and a father from The Pas, he had strong support systems in both communities. ""It bound the communities together, because everyone was just so supportive of him and just wished him the best,"" said Conaty. ""He was amazing. I honestly don't know of one person in our community who isn't somehow already connected to him through family and friends or through hockey. He touched a lot of souls."" A spokesperson for University College of the North said Ryder spent many summers in one of the school's kids' programs. The college displayed a message of support for him at its campus in The Pas, with a sign reading #RyderStrong in the windows. ""Whether you knew Ryder or not, his story of strength while facing such a terrible disease is both inspiring and heart breaking,"" spokesperson Monte Koshel wrote in an email on Saturday. ""I don't personally know Ryder's family, but after I dropped my daughter off for a play date last night, I had to drive through tears while jersey after jersey was displayed in everyone's windows."" Over the course of his treatment last year, Ryder seemed to be getting better, Conaty said. ""It was a super big thrill for the kids,"" he said. ""He came back in his wheelchair, but he was able to come and spend some time with all of his teammates and even go on the ice. And then again he progressed and had one heck of a year."" Even a month ago, things were looking up. ""The tumor was shrinking and that was a blessing,"" said MacInnis. ""[This] past December, they said it had shrunk so much, that things looked good. They had a positive visit in December."" But a few weeks ago, things took a turn for the worse. After Ryder started having seizures, tests revealed the cancer had spread rapidly through his spinal cord fluid. And on Friday morning, the nine-year-old took his last breath. Now, the communities are focused on the person they've lost, and on how they can make sure he's never forgotten. ""It's tough. It's really hard. But I think from here, there's probably many lessons that people have learned and we just know how much Ryder loved everybody. And it'll probably stay with people for a long time,"" said MacInnis. Conaty said Ryder's friends and family are coming up with ways to keep his legacy going. ""Our whole communities are really devastated right now,"" said Conaty. ""We just have to kind of propel ourselves forward. Take that fierceness that Ryder had, and focus it on positivity and doing good in the communities."" For now, they're starting with something small, something familiar. On Monday, Ryder's friends and family are asking other people, even outside the communities, to hang a jersey in their front windows in honour of a huge hockey fan who saw his last game too soon. ""He was one of the fiercest, fiercest kids out there. Always had a lot of hustle, always skating super hard for the puck, had a really good attitude,"" said Conaty. ""An extremely kind child, lots of energy. Big, chubby cheeks. He was an amazing soul.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/remembering-ryder-northern-manitobans-hang-hockey-jerseys-for-boy-lost-to-cancer-1.5432307,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-jets-choir-ojibwe-o-canada-1.5429759 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/hockey-wedding-cancer-newlyweds-1.5386245 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/stelio-mattheos-nhl-testicular-cancer-1.5260552 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pas-huskies-first-place-good-deeds-cup-1.4507195,/news/canada/manitoba/brady-keeper-florida-panthers-1.5062106 /news/canada/manitoba/opaskwayak-cree-nation-blizzard-assistant-coach-fired-1.5386944 /news/canada/manitoba/brady-keeper-nhl-debut-1.5076679
189,"Katie Pedersen, Melissa Mancini, David Common",2019-11-23T16:17:02.731Z,Seniors' homes using 'trespass orders' to ban family members from visiting,"Mary Sardelis wasn't allowed to visit her 97-year-old mother's Ottawa retirement home for almost a year. Sardelis lives less than five minutes away from her mother Voula, but the home prevented Sardelis from seeing her, using sections of Ontario's trespass law. ""For 316 days … I was banned from entering the home,"" she said. ""You have no idea of the toll it's taken."" She could call, but her mother's hearing is poor and she often couldn't understand what her daughter was saying.  ""All I could hear was her fears or concerns. And I couldn't even soothe her."" Sardelis was banned from City View Retirement Community under Ontario's Trespass to Property Act. So-called trespass orders allow private property owners to limit who can come onto the premises and, some experts say, are being increasingly used to keep out family members who complain about conditions in retirement and long-term care homes. It's difficult to know how often homes ban or restrict family members, since families have to breach the trespass order for there to be any record of it. WATCH: Daughter banned from visiting 97-year-old mother at retirement home. Jane Meadus, a lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto, estimates she gets calls about trespass orders in long-term care homes and retirement homes at least once a week.  ""Generally, what happens is that it's a family member who is in visiting their family member and they get upset,"" she said. Marketplace reviewed over a dozen cases of family members from provinces across Canada who say they believe the homes were trying to silence them for advocating on behalf of their loved ones. ""The person maybe raises their voices and the home says, 'Well, that's it. You're not coming anymore, because we see you as a danger,'"" said Meadus. WATCH: Voula Sardelis waves to her daughter on the sidewalk outside her retirement home. ""If [the complainants] were really a danger, they should be calling the police. So if they were actually threatening someone, that's what they should be doing, ""But instead, what they're doing is to try to control their premises, trying to stifle people from complaining and trying to stifle people from speaking out on behalf of these very vulnerable seniors."" The home told Marketplace they prohibited Sardelis from visiting her mother because she was ""aggressive"" towards staff. But she believes she was banned for speaking out and filing complaints about the living conditions at the home which she felt were intolerable. Meadus said in Ontario, homes do not have the right to ban residents' visitors. When it comes to retirement homes, residents who pay to live on the property have a right to receive visitors they choose ""without interference,"" she said, citing case law established in Cunningham vs. Whitby Christian Non-Profit Housing Corp. That case found that banning guests of a tenant would contravene Section 23 (1) of the Ontario Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, which entitles a tenant to ""quiet enjoyment"" of their space. Meadus says in the case of long-term care, they have the same rights under Section 3 (14) of the Long-Term Care Homes Act, which states that every resident has the right ""to receive visitors of his or her choice … without interference."" The home says it ""disagrees"" with that analysis and that it has the right to ban anyone deemed to have breached its ""zero-tolerance abuse"" policy. Meadus has been invited to train Toronto's police officers on how to deal with calls from retirement and long-term care homes that try to use Trespass to Property Act against family members. ""When we talk to police officers, they're surprised and they're usually very grateful that we've provided that information to them. That's not something that they're trained for generally,"" she said. Meadus says often the families she has heard from have negotiated for restricted visits, agreeing to only come into the home during certain hours or under certain conditions.  That was the case for Susan Macaulay, who says her mother's Quebec long-term care home threatened to ban her, and ultimately issued restrictions on her visits. ""I was a thorn in the side of the managers,"" she said. ""They threatened on several occasions to not allow me to see my mother."" Macaulay said the home sent her a letter stating that she would only be allowed to visit between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. — the two hours of the afternoon when her mom was normally asleep. She said she tried to explain to her mother, who had dementia, why she wasn't going to be visiting as much. ""If I don't come to visit, it's not because I don't want to,"" she recalls telling her mother.  ""I thought that if they stopped me from coming to see her, she would never know why I didn't come."" Macaulay faced restrictions on her visits to her mother for 18 months, until her mother died. In Ontario, the Trespass to Property Act doesn't allow people who have been issued a ban to fight it. Once a notice or verbal warning is given to someone on the property, the only way to fight the ban is to go back to the property and wait for the owner to call the police. Meadus says most of the time, families don't challenge the order, because they would have to get arrested to do so.  But for Mary Sardelis, her fear of being arrested wasn't enough to stop her. In March 2019, she went into the retirement home even though she was banned and waited for the home to call the police and arrest her. She hoped that this way, she would be able to bring the matter before a judge. The police were called, and Sardelis was charged under the Trespass to Property Act. ""Someone had to do something,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it will just keep going on and on and on."" But in October, Sardelis found out she wouldn't have to go to court after all. Her lawyer met with the home's lawyers, after which the prosecutors dropped the charges. The home told Marketplace it will let her visit as long as she follows their rules. Although her battle is seemingly over, Sardelis said on behalf of her mother, she'll continue to advocate for other family members in her community who have been banned from visiting their loved ones. ""I'll do whatever it takes to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" she said. ""I will not stop.""

190,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-18T10:00:00.319Z,P.E.I. readies to appoint new child advocate during spring sitting,"The P.E.I. government is making moves to allow a new independent child advocate to be appointed during the spring sitting of the legislature. On Saturday, Section 2 of the province's new Child and Youth Advocate Act came into effect, allowing for the position to be filled. The remainder of the legislation will come into effect April 3, according to an order from the provincial cabinet made at its Jan. 7 meeting. Opposition Leader Peter Bevan-Baker, a member of the committee which will ultimately put forward a candidate for approval by the legislative assembly, said a professional hiring agency will be used to conduct a competitive process that is ""open and independent and non-partisan."" Bevan-Baker said a key role for the new child advocate will be ""to critique government when things don't go well. And if you have an officer who … has been chosen with any sort of sense of partisanship or politics being involved, then that role is not truly independent."" A year ago, the government of Wade MacLauchlan — after years of delays — announced it would create a position for a children's commissioner and advocate, appointing former deputy minister Michele Dorsey to that role. But the opposition PCs and Greens complained that Dorsey did not sit as an independent officer of the legislature, similar to the auditor general, but rather served at the pleasure of the premier. A bill passed unanimously in the P.E.I. Legislature in November of 2019 to create a position for a new child and youth advocate to function as an independent officer of the legislative assembly. According to that legislation, a candidate recommended by the province's legislative management committee requires the support of at least two-thirds of MLAs in a vote in the House to be appointed to the position. In November the province issued a tender for a new office for the future child and youth advocate, specifying the office could not be on the same floor as any other government department or service in order to maintain the independence of the position.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-appointment-child-advocate-1.5431079,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-and-youth-advocate-act-passes-1.5367314 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-advocate-office-1.5348782 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-advocate-1.4983425 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-program-seniors-chours-jan-2020-1.5431114 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-weather-windy-cancellations-january-17-2020-1.5430515,/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-and-youth-advocate-act-passes-1.5367314 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-advocate-office-1.5348782
191,Alex Migdal,2020-01-21T02:26:15.671Z,Screening measures initiated at Vancouver airport for China coronavirus outbreak,"Passengers at the Vancouver International Airport will encounter new screening measures as Canadian health officials keep a close eye on China's coronavirus outbreak, which has killed three people and infected more than 200. The Public Health Agency of Canada says it will introduce messaging over the coming week on arrivals screens reminding travellers from Wuhan, China — the site of the outbreak — to inform a border service officer if they experience flu-like symptoms. An extra health screening question will be added to electronic immigration kiosks. The changes will also be introduced at the Toronto and Montreal airports. The measures are less stringent than those introduced over the weekend at three major airports in New York City (JFK), San Francisco and Los Angeles, where incoming airline passengers are being screened for symptoms. ""Right now, it's not a major threat to us here in Canada but we are watching very carefully,"" said Dr. Bonnie Henry,  B.C.'s provincial health officer.  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that typically cause mild cold-like symptoms. Some forms of the infection can lead to more severe illnesses, such as pneumonia, respiratory and kidney failure. The virus is linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed dozens of Canadians in 2002 and 2003, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Both caused severe illnesses in humans and were transmitted rapidly around the world.  ""This one doesn't seem to be as easily transmitted from person-to-person and we haven't seen the explosive kinds of outbreaks that we saw with MERS and SARS,"" Henry said. ""That's a little bit reassuring but it's still early days and there's much we don't know."" The outbreak, which originated at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China, has since spread to Japan, Thailand and South Korea, with 136 new cases reported over the weekend. On Monday, China confirmed the first human-to-human transmission, which could make the virus spread more quickly and widely. China's Xinhau News Agency said 224 cases have been reported and 217 confirmed.  Fears have also been raised that the illness could spread to Canada, as people travel for Lunar New Year on Saturday. The Public Health Agency of Canada says the overall risk to Canadians is low given that the country has no direct flights to Wuhan and the volume of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control issued guidelines last week on diagnosing patients, but says definitive testing is still being developed. Brian Conway, the medical director at the Vancouver Infectious DIseases Centre, says there's no evidence that British Columbians should be worried. ""How far and how quickly this epidemic will spread has not been established,"" he said. ""So, it's time to be vigilant rather than concerned or worry."" At least five new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Beijing and two cases are suspected in Shanghai. The Vancouver International Airport offers direct flights to both cities. The Vancouver Airport Authority declined to comment on the new screening measures and said it follows the guidelines by Canada's public health agency. Boyd Thomson, who was walking in Vancouver's Chinatown on Monday, said he's flying to Japan next week and is considering switching his layover in China. ""I'm mildly concerned,"" he said. ""I'll pay attention to the news between now and then and bring my anti-bacteria cream."" If a traveller shows symptoms, Canada border agents can alert a public health quarantine officer, according to PHAC. The border agent will typically do a preliminary screening, while the quarantine officer will perform a more detailed assessment. Several Canadian airports extensively screened passengers during Toronto's 2003 SARS outbreak but a study that year found the measures to be costly and ineffective. $7.55 million was spent on screening 6.5 million travellers, with 9,100 passengers isolated by nurses or quarantine officers. But the screening failed to detect one case of the disease, the study concluded. The report's authors from the Public Health of Agency suggested the money would have been better spent on stepping up screening procedures at hospitals, clinics and doctors' officers, where sick travellers are likely to go.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/swartz-bay-ferry-terminal-protest-1.5433100 /news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149 /news/canada/british-columbia/rcmp-seeking-identify-fraud-suspects-1.5433589

Ultimately, it will be their decision,"" Sajjan said from the Middle East, where he is visiting Canadian forces. ""Just like we have a parliamentary process that we follow, they have their own as well. We are there at the request of the Iraqi government. If they were to change that, we do have to respect that."" Canada has about 500 military members in Iraq associated with two separate missions. Canadians were part of the NATO mission to train Iraqi security and armed forces, and also took part in the U.S.-led coalition mission to hunt down remnants of the Islamic State, or ISIS. Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top military commander, halted both those missions earlier this month after the U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani at the Baghdad airport increased the risk to foreign troops in the region. The Department of National Defence said Thursday both missions remain on hold, although some supply missions have taken place. In the wake of the Soleimani killing, Iraq's Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution calling on the Iraqi government to expel foreign troops from the country. Adel Abdul Mahdi, now the caretaker prime minister since resigning in November, supported the call. Sajjan said that discussions are taking place between the two countries as Canada looks to get its mission back on track. ""The current Iraqi leadership realizes why we came here in the first place, which is actually to help Iraq, to stop the scourge of Daesh, known as ISIS, from controlling the country,"" he said. ""Obviously the Iraqi government has concerns. We're listening to those concerns."" Sajjan said that, for now, the priority of the Canadian mission in the region is to ensure the safety of Canadian Forces on the ground. He said no decision will be made on resuming either mission until the security situation improves. ""We are looking at all measures to get back, to continuing both our missions within the coalition but … we will only do so when the security situation is appropriate,"" Sajjan said. Sajjan would not say how many Canadian soldiers are now in Iraq, or if any of the Canadian personnel who moved out of the country in the wake of the drone strike have returned. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo spoke with Foreign Affairs Minister François‑Philippe Champagne about the possibility of NATO expanding its role in the region. According to a readout of the conversation from the U.S. Department of State, the two foreign ministers "" … spoke about the Iranian regime's continued aggressive and destabilizing actions in the region and steps to contain it, specifically the opportunity for an expanded NATO force in Iraq and appropriate burden sharing."" Asked if the U.S. had made a specific request of Canada, Sajjan said that while Canadian participation in the missions was always intended to change as the situation on the ground changes, no formal request of Canada has yet been made. ""There are no asks based on one nation,"" Sajjan said. ""This is about working together as part of a coalition because that's what good coalition partners do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sajjan-troops-leave-request-1.5431700,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-iraq-iran-nato-1.5423203 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-troops-vance-iraq-kuwait-1.5417627 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-soleimani-trump-trudeau-iraq-1.5422308 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-iraq-soleimani-isis-islamic-state-1.5416383 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nato-training-iraq-mission-suspended-1.5415166,/news/politics/nato-training-iraq-mission-suspended-1.5415166 /news/politics/canada-iran-iraq-soleimani-isis-islamic-state-1.5416383 /news/politics/canadian-troops-vance-iraq-kuwait-1.5417627 /news/politics/iran-soleimani-trump-trudeau-iraq-1.5422308 /news/politics/trump-iraq-iran-nato-1.5423203
193,Bob Weber,2020-01-20T17:52:59.355Z,Studies question assumptions on industrial damage to Wood Buffalo park,"New research suggests Canada's largest national park is not drying out from upstream hydro dams or being contaminated by the oilsands. Recently published papers from scientists at the University of Waterloo question previous studies done for the federal government and the United Nations as well as long-held conclusions from Indigenous people. ""Our findings counter widespread perceptions,"" said Roland Hall, an aquatic ecologist who is one of the co-authors. ""There's been lots of controversy and claims that weren't necessarily supported by data.""  Others say the jury is still out.  ""[The scientists] overstate their position, stretching the applicability of their limited dataset,"" said Melody Lepine of the Mikisew Cree First Nation. The band has long voiced concerns about its traditional land in northern Alberta's Peace-Athabasca Delta and Wood Buffalo National Park.  The park is one of the world's largest freshwater deltas and a World Heritage Site. But its water levels have been dropping, which the Mikisew blame largely on B.C. Hydro's W.A.C. Bennett Dam. They also say contaminants have been flowing downstream from the oilsands.  In 2014, the Mikisew voiced concerns to UNESCO, which asked Canada to assess the park's 45,000 square kilometres of grasslands, wetlands and waterways. That study found ecological health was declining from climate change, dams and industry. It also noted the proposed Teck Frontier oilsands mine, waiting for federal cabinet approval, is only 20 kilometres south of the park. UNESCO is considering the park's status while Parks Canada considers a $27.5-million plan to rescue it. But after analyzing 150 years worth of lake and delta sediment cores, Hall said dams and industry aren't the problem.  Parts of the delta are drying out and climate change may play a part, he said. But the biggest factor, Hall said, is the Embarras River, which redirected large volumes of water when it broke its banks in 1982.  ""It's probably the biggest hydrological event of the century and you don't even find it mentioned,"" said Hall. What's more, researchers found that the delta didn't start drying out until the 1980s. The W.A.C. Bennett Dam was built in 1968. The cores, which were examined for six heavy metals associated with oilsands, revealed changes over time that predate development. ""We see flat lines, no rising trends,"" Hall said. Joshua Kurek, an ecologist at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, was not involved in the study, but called the papers valuable. ""We have a scarcity of observations and their approach provides convincing evidence of fairly stable baselines,"" he said. But Kurek pointed out that industry releases many more chemicals than those considered by the researchers. As well, Kurek noted, the cores were taken from a small area of the delta far from oilsands mines. ""It's definitely not the final answer."" Lepine said in an email that the research didn't test for contaminants other studies have found, including mercury, arsenic and many carcinogenic chemicals. And the paper doesn't look at the dam's impact on the Peace River, she added. Hall, who has been working in the area for 20 years, said conflicting theories speak to how little data is available on the large, complex, remote region and how hard it is to study. ""It's not an easy place to figure stuff out."" He suggests others may have let assumptions influence them. ""Almost from Day 1, it was anticipated that [the dam] would cause negative changes,"" Hall said. ""That idea has been in people's minds for so long that other possibilities are not being explored.""  He stands by the conclusions in his papers.  ""The extent to which industrial developments have altered the delta are not as bad as feared. ""It doesn't mean industry can't change things in the future. This system is still very much acting like a natural system, but there is a strong need for continued monitoring."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/studies-question-industrial-damage-wood-buffalo-park-1.5432874,[],[]
194,Yvonne Colbert,2019-11-20T19:47:55.495Z,N.S. man takes one of world's biggest automakers to court — and wins,"Most people might be hesitant to take one of the world's biggest automakers to court. But not Nine Mile River, N.S., resident Ranulph Hudston, who persisted in his battle to have Volkswagen honour its 12-year corrosion warranty. The retired educator wouldn't take no for an answer when his 2007 Jetta started rusting and the company denied his warranty claim. He decided to take Volkswagen to Nova Scotia small claims court, and earlier this month won a judgment of $7,886.40 to pay for the repair costs. ""I was very surprised and very pleased,"" Hudston said of the court's Nov. 7 ruling. ""As I read the decision, I saw a lot of what I put into the case coming back to me as the truth, and the truth coming through felt really good."" His win came despite a list from Volkswagen of possible causes for the corrosion on the Jetta's door sills and rocker panels, including tree sap, bird droppings, shoe buckles and an improperly stored seatbelt. In her ruling, small claims adjudicator Shelly Martin didn't buy any of the excuses, saying she failed ""to see how a seatbelt or footwear could affect the areas in question, as the site of corrosion is not easily in contact with footwear or a seatbelt."" The 12-year corrosion warranty was provided to Hudston when he bought the vehicle brand new in 2007. He first noticed rust on the left front fender when his Jetta was almost seven years old. He went back to Hillcrest Volkswagen in Halifax, where he purchased the vehicle. He was then sent to a Volkswagen-authorized repair shop, which fixed most of the rusted areas and replaced the right quarter panel. But three years later, in 2017, he noticed blistering paint and a small strip of paint peeling on the rocker panels, as well as blistering paint on the front door sills. He took the Jetta to a body shop for repairs and was told the body work under the paint was rusting. He was advised the repairs should be covered under Volkswagen's warranty. Hudston went back to Hillcrest, where he was told to fill out an online inspection request that included acceptance of additional terms and conditions that were not in the original warranty. One new clause said any decisions by Volkswagen were final, while another said repairs must be made ""promptly."" Hudston was subsequently sent for a repair estimate where a technician told him any attempt to clean the rust on the door sill would likely ""blow a hole right through it."" More than a month later, Hillcrest Volkswagen told him the repair would not be covered, saying the corrosion was not the type covered by his warranty. It also refused to cover the rocker panels. Hudston continued to push Volkswagen to pay for the repairs, but the company responded in an email: ""We are unable to base our decisions on information received from independent shops and our decision remains unchanged."" It cited a number of reasons why the corrosion might have occurred — ranging from bird droppings, to rocks, to lack of rust proofing — and also suggested the problem was due to a general lack of maintenance. But in her decision, Martin noted photos of the vehicle showed ""an older but well cared for Jetta, stored in an impeccable clean garage."" The adjudicator said she was not convinced that any of the reasons provided by Volkswagen ""were of sufficient magnitude in the location of the corrosion to be its cause."" She also noted that three technicians that inspected the vehicle suggested it was corrosion covered under the warranty. George Iny, with the consumer advocacy group Automobile Protection Association, said he's not surprised by the potential causes cited by Volkswagen. He said automakers have a template for rust cases that includes 18 reasons why corrosion might have occurred. ""In many cases, they would just throw as many as they can and hope that one or two will stick. They really need only one for the judge to be convinced they are not responsible,"" he said. He calls it ""laughable"" that Volkswagen would say bird droppings are responsible for the rust on vertical surfaces on the lower part of the car. Iny said his organization has heard from dozens of Volkswagen owners who have had difficulty getting their corrosion warranties honoured. As a result, his group has posted tips on its website. Iny noted Volkswagen last year reduced its warranty from 12 to seven years, which he said is still good coverage by industry standards.  ""The impression we have is that they're applying that reduction retroactively and they're not supposed to do that,"" he said. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Canada, Thomas Tetzlaff, said the automaker takes all matters of quality very seriously and always honours the full terms of its warranties. He said while the company respects the court's decision, it is now considering whether to appeal. Iny said Hudston's case is a template for other Volkswagen owners facing rust problems. He said people can't go to court and simply say, ""I have a warranty and my vehicle is rusting."" He said vehicle owners need an expert or, at the very least, a report from an expert. Hudston, who has owned numerous Volkswagens and thinks they're excellent cars, said it was the company's own actions that led him to continue his fight. ""They didn't seem to want to hear me. They, in fact, seemed to be stonewalling me and I guess that insulted me. I expect to be respected by the companies I buy products from,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/warranty-corrosion-volkswagen-group-canada-small-claims-court-1.5363613,[],/news/canada/british-columbia/continental-tire-warranty-mileage-exaggerated-1.5055006 /news/toyota-offers-buyback-extended-warranty-options-for-tacoma-trucks-1.742209 /news/canada/nova-scotia/automobiles-recall-honda-canada-consumers-buy-back-1.5080925
195,Jason Proctor,2020-01-19T18:20:22.518Z,What to expect from Meng Wanzhou's extradition hearing this week,"The eyes of the world will be on Vancouver this week as Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou takes a seat in a B.C. courtroom for the first phase of her extradition hearing. The 47-year-old chief financial officer has been living under house arrest since December 2018, when she was released on $10 million bail pending the conclusion of proceedings to determine if she should be sent to the United States to face fraud charges related to allegations that she violated U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. In a five-day hearing starting Monday, a judge will hear arguments on so-called double criminality. CBC brings you up to date on the arguments for and against as well as the background of the case. A B.C. Supreme Court judge has to decide if the offence American prosecutors have accused Meng of committing would be prosecutable if the alleged conduct had occurred in Canada. This is a principle known as ""double criminality,"" and it is at the core of the Extradition Act. The Act says the conduct doesn't have to be ""named, defined or characterized"" the same way on both sides of the border, but it would have to be punishable by jail time in Canada. For Meng to be extradited, the Crown must prove double criminality. The U.S. Department of Justice has charged Meng with bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The allegations arise from a series of Reuters articles in 2012 and 2013 that claimed Huawei had misrepresented its relationship with Skycom, a firm accused of offering to sell U.S. computer equipment to an Iranian telecommunications company in violation of U.S. economic sanctions. The articles alleged that Skycom — which Huawei described as a local partner in Iran — was in fact controlled by the Chinese telecommunication giant. In response to concerns raised by banking executives, Meng allegedly met with an HSBC executive in a Hong Kong restaurant on Aug. 22, 2013, to give a PowerPoint presentation denying the relationship. U.S. prosecutors say HSBC and other banks continued their business relationship with Huawei based on Meng's assurances — putting themselves at risk of violating U.S. economic sanctions and criminal prosecution. Meng's lawyers claim her conduct would not be prosecutable if it had occurred in Canada because Canada did not have the same economic sanctions against Iran at the time Meng's extradition warrant was sworn. In a written argument filed in advance of this week's hearing, they frame the issue this way: ""A walks into a bank in Canada. B works for the bank and asks A whether her company is doing business in Iran. A misrepresents to B that her company is not doing business in Iran. The bank then processes financial transactions in Canada for A's company related to Iran,"" the defence lawyers write. ""The fundamental question is whether A has committed the crime of fraud in Canada. The answer is no. Since Canada does not prohibit A's company doing business in Iran, there is no risk of deprivation to the bank under Canadian law."" Lawyers for Canada's attorney general say the alleged offence is fraud — which is a crime in both the U.S. and Canada. The Crown says the decision the judge has to make gets at the heart of Canadian extradition law, which is ""conduct based"" as opposed to ""offence matching."" They say the object of the hearing is not to compare specific elements of laws in each country, but to consider the ""essence"" of the alleged offence. They say the judge may consider American economic sanctions to provide context — but only as a means to understand why the bank might have faced problems by trusting Meng's word. ""The fact that Canada may have different sanctions against Iran than the United States should not distract the court,"" the Crown claims. ""Deceit and risk of loss are at the heart of the conduct."" It's tough to say. There are not a lot of similar cases of people facing extradition because of alleged violation of U.S. economic sanctions. Vancouver lawyer Gary Botting, who has written a book on extradition between Canada and the U.S., says if B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes follows recent precedent, she may side with the Crown. Botting says in the last decade, with the blessing of the Supreme Court of Canada, courts have moved away from superimposing a complete set of facts into a Canadian setting to determine double criminality. ""[They've said] if there is any kind of aspect of the law — like the lowest common denominator of the law — that is criminal, then it becomes criminal in Canada."" But Botting says because of the unusual nature of the case and its complicated circumstances, the judge might want to look further back for precedent. ""She'll say, 'No this isn't criminal in Canada.' How can we arrest somebody who's done something in Hong Kong to a bank registered in England?"" he says. ""What jurisdiction does the United States have or would Canada have? That's the situation."" If double criminality is not met, the extradition proceedings would be over, although the Crown could appeal. But if the Crown wins, the next significant court dates for Meng will occur in May as part of the lead-up to a hearing in June to address Meng's allegations that her rights were violated during her arrest at Vancouver International Airport. If that hearing goes ahead, Meng will claim that Canadian authorities conspired with American authorities to mount a covert criminal operation against her at the time of her detention and arrest. She will also seek to have the extradition proceedings tossed out in relation to her claim she is being used as a pawn by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would intervene in Meng's case if doing so would achieve a better trade deal with China.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-arrest-anniversary-blog-post-1.5380500 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/huawei-iran-syria-meng-china-1.4970107 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-huawei-canada-china-1.5187662 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/huawei-meng-extradition-millions-iran-1.4942164 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-disclosure-documents-1.5391535,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia
196,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:51:58.742Z,"Quebec dairy mogul Lino Saputo had secret past dealings with U.S. mobster Joe Bonanno, then lied about it","Lino Saputo turned his family's humble cheesemaking business into a multibillion-dollar global dairy empire and became one of the 10 richest people in Canada in the process. But while amassing his $6.5-billion fortune, Saputo has also been dogged by allegations of having ties to powerful Mafia figures in both Canada and the United States. The 82-year-old businessman has repeatedly denied those allegations, most recently in a memoir published last year. He devotes an entire chapter to disputing the claims. ""We respected the law, kept our distance from criminal organizations, and avoided crossing the wrong people,"" Saputo writes in Entrepreneur: Living our dreams. But between 1964 and 1979, Saputo maintained a clandestine relationship with one of the most powerful gangsters in the U.S., according to police evidence uncovered by Enquête, Radio-Canada's investigative program. The evidence, gathered by federal and state law enforcement officials in the 1970s, details personal and financial dealings between Saputo and Joseph Bonanno, considered one of the founding members of the American Mafia. In 1980, a retired New York judge reviewed the police evidence as part of an administrative hearing. The former judge determined Saputo was so closely linked to Bonanno that allowing him to do business in New York was not in the public interest. Before Saputo Inc. became the dairy industry giant it is today, employing 17,000 people around the world, the family operated a cheesemaking business from a modest building in Montreal's Saint-Michel neighbourhood. In the early 1960s, the building was also home to the Saputo family, including Lino, then in his mid-20s, and his father Giuseppe. It was here, in May 1964, that the Saputos had lunch with Bonanno. At the time, Bonanno was in charge of one of the so-called Five Families, the crime syndicates that composed the New York Mafia. Bonanno says in his autobiography, A Man of Honor, that he only met with the Saputos at the insistence of a mutual friend. However, in an immigration document that he filed during his stay in Montreal, Bonanno claimed to have known the Saputos since the early 1960s. He calls them his ""friends."" The May 1964 meeting resulted in a business proposal. Giuseppe Saputo drew up a letter offering to sell Bonanno a 20 per cent stake in three companies then owned by his family, in exchange for $8,000 (around $66,000 when adjusted for inflation). In his memoir, Lino Saputo says his family had no idea who Bonanno was when they agreed to the deal. When Bonanno was later arrested by Montreal police for an immigration violation, Saputo saw him described as ""the king of the Mafia"" in a newspaper headline. According to Saputo's account, his father ""rushed"" to cancel the deal. ""We thought that was the end of it, as the agreement was never finalized,"" Saputo wrote. But suspicions that he had ties to the Mafia continued to follow Saputo throughout the 1970s. They were unfounded, he said, and hurt his business. ""I felt victimized and cut off from Quebec society by the false allegations based solely on our Italian origins,"" he wrote. In 1978, under the auspices of one of his companies, Lino Saputo applied for a licence to operate a cheese-manufacturing business in New York state. State officials were reluctant to grant the application after they learned of the 1964 business deal between Saputo and Bonanno. During the administrative hearings into his application, Saputo said under oath that the meeting in Montreal was the first and only time he had met Bonanno. Saputo's memoir notes simply that the ""judge eventually rejected our request,"" adding that a competitor and a Quebec agriculture official testified on his behalf. The reason, though, was that the judge had concluded in 1980 that Saputo gave ""false, misleading and deceitful statements"" about his ties with Bonanno. Radio-Canada accessed all of the evidence that U.S. law enforcement submitted to the administrative hearings into Saputo's application. Along with testimony from U.S. law enforcement officials, the 1,500 pages of evidence detailed how Saputo disguised interactions and financial dealings with Bonanno between 1964 and 1979. During the hearings, Saputo was asked if he had seen Bonanno after May 1964. ""No, sir,"" Saputo replied. He was then asked: ""Were you in Tucson, Arizona, on February 1, 1970?"" Saputo answered: ""Not that I remember, sir."" But FBI informants had spotted Saputo and his wife, Mirella, visiting Bonanno at his home in Tucson on that day. An FBI agent also told the New York hearings the Saputos were checked in under the name ""Saparo"" at a Tucson Holiday Inn between Jan. 30 and Feb. 1, 1970. Though Bonanno had by this time ""retired"" as head of the New York crime syndicate that bore his family name, authorities believed he was still active in criminal activity in Arizona and California. Investigators in the U.S. presented no other evidence that Saputo and Bonanno had met in person after 1970. They did, however, present evidence indicating the pair remained in contact, at least until the end of the 1970s. Beginning in the summer of 1975, the Arizona Drug Control District, a cross-agency task force, placed Bonanno's Tucson home under surveillance. Twice a week, Bonanno (then in his 70s) would dutifully put his trash cans by the curb. An undercover police van would drive by the house discreetly soon after. Officers inside the van took the contents from the bins and filled them again with fake garbage — all in less than 45 seconds. They even plied Bonanno's Doberman with meat to prevent the dog from barking. State and FBI investigators would then sift through Bonanno's garbage. Bonanno was a diligent note-taker, tearing them up and throwing them out when he was done. Between 1975 and 1979, police were able to piece back together around 6,000 notes and other documents from Bonanno's trash cans. ""We learned, by both studying him and watching him, that he was the most powerful Mafioso in the United States ... and had specific influence, we learned, in Canada and throughout Latin America,"" said Eugene Ehmann, a former investigator with the Arizona Drug Control District who played a leading role in the operation against Bonanno. ""Bonanno was still an actively known figure in New York ... He was the godfather, plain and simple."" Among the notes, investigators noticed references to ""Lino."" Several notes, for instance, seemed to suggest that Bonanno had helped organize a trip to California for him. ""Lino is a person of mine with no charge (1) at the hotel (2) no charge at the restaurant,"" reads the FBI translation of a note written in Italian. In a recent interview with Radio-Canada, Ehmann (now retired) said that with help from the RCMP, his team determined ""Lino"" was Lino Saputo. ""They seemed to interact very smoothly with each other,"" Ehmann said of Saputo and Bonanno. ""They just had a relationship, and it was a longtime one."" In 1979, authorities finally searched Bonanno's house itself. A few days later, the mobster dumped 1,200 notes in the trash, seemingly unaware he was still under surveillance. This latest dump included newspaper articles from Quebec that discussed Bonanno and the Mafia. Police also found lawyers' letters, financial statements and investment scenarios that linked Bonanno to Saputo and his businesses. ""[Bonanno] had obviously panicked and wanted to get rid of these documents which have — as we now have found — connected him more deeply in his relationships with Saputo Cheese,"" Ehmann said. The notes in Bonanno's garbage often referred to liquido, an Italian word for cash. In several notes, Bonanno wrote that he needed to discuss liquido with someone called Peppe Freddo. Bonanno received multiple calls from Peppe Freddo during the 1970s at telephone booths in a Tucson hospital, which were being monitored by law enforcement officials. Ehmann said an FBI agent was occasionally lying on a stretcher nearby, trying to understand what was being discussed. With the help of the RCMP, Ehmann said, agents in the U.S. concluded that Peppe Freddo was a code name for Giuseppe Borsellino. Borsellino had been a business partner of Saputo's since the 1960s and was an early shareholder in his cheese businesses. He is also married to Saputo's sister, Elina. Aside from their telephone conversations in the 1970s, Borsellino also corresponded with Bonanno. In one 1975 letter found by police, Borsellino apologizes profusely for failing to call at an agreed-upon time. In another, Bonanno tells Borsellino: ""I would like, if possible, to hear the voice of your brother-in-law and speak with him."" At the cheese-licensing hearings in New York, Ehmann and his colleagues presented evidence that Saputo colluded in funnelling $51,000 US to Bonanno (worth around $210,000 US today). The money was withdrawn from an account belonging to a business owned by Borsellino's brother and was meant to pay an outstanding bill to one of Saputo's cheese companies. But a disused money wrapper found in Bonanno's trash, along with several recovered notes, was evidence the cash wound up instead at Bonanno's home. Law enforcement authorities presented their evidence about Saputo's ties to Bonanno over the course of a 10-day administrative hearing in 1980. A retired appeals court judge, Charles D. Breitel, was appointed to preside over the hearing. He recommended the state refuse Saputo's application for a cheese-manufacturing licence. In his recommendation, Breitel singled out the $51,000 in cash. He considered it a fact the money went to Bonanno ""with the knowledge and collusion"" of Saputo. ""Joseph Bonanno has had significant economic and transactional involvement over a substantial period of years with several Canadian cheese companies owned by the members of the Saputo family and by Lino Saputo in particular,"" Breitel wrote in his 1980 report. The evidence, he said, pointed to a relationship that lasted between 1964 and 1979. Breitel added: ""Lino Saputo has attempted to conceal from the Department his and his companies' involvement with Bonanno, he has failed to furnish all the material information required by the Commissioner, and has made material statements that are false, misleading, and deceitful."" Breitel's determination was confirmed on appeal. The investigation by U.S. law enforcement into Saputo's ties with Bonanno ended with the decision to withhold the cheesemaking licence. Bonanno died in 2002 at the age of 97. His obituaries claimed he was the model for actor Marlon Brando's character in The Godfather. Saputo Inc. went public in 1997. The company, which has operations in Australia, Argentina, the U.S. and the U.K., is worth an estimated $15 billion. Saputo, a member of the Order of Canada, has never been charged with a criminal offence. He declined an interview request from Radio-Canada's investigative unit. In a letter, Saputo's lawyer said his client has ""never had ties to organized crime, be it in a direct or indirect manner."" Saputo's memoir refers to the ""nightmare"" of ""false allegations"" about being tied to the Mafia.  There is no mention in Saputo's book to Borsellino's links to Bonanno. The one reference to  Borsellino reads: ""We also founded Petra, our real estate arm, now one of the largest private real estate companies in Québec, with over 8.3 million square feet of property in Montréal. My dear friend and brother-in-law Giuseppe Borsellino is president."" Borsellino has been in contact with other Mafia figures besides Bonanno. In 1995, Borsellino and his wife, Elina Saputo, attended a wedding anniversary party for Nicolo Rizzuto and Libertina Manno. They can be identified in a video of the event that was given to Radio-Canada by a confidential source. Rizzuto's son, Vito, was also present. He was widely considered at the time to be the head of the Montreal Mafia. Court documents have identified both Rizzutos as members of the Bonanno crime family. A confidential police document obtained by Radio-Canada alleges Borsellino had contact with the Rizzutos at least until the mid-2000s. Like Saputo, Borsellino has never been charged with a crime. He, too, declined to answer questions from Radio-Canada. His lawyer said in a letter that Borsellino, who remains chair of Groupe Petra's board, had done ""nothing wrong."" Radio-Canada asked Saputo to comment on his brother-in-law's contact with the Rizzutos. He did not respond. Reporting by Gaétan Pouliot and Marie-Maude Denis.

197,Don Pittis,2020-01-20T09:00:32.906Z,Statistics are great unless they measure the wrong things: Don Pittis,"If prices are rising by about two per cent, as inflation data is likely to show this week, why did one of my newspaper subscriptions just go up by 17 per cent? And if wages are rising at about four per cent, as recent jobs data has shown, why are some provincial governments insisting that wage increases be held below one per cent? As house prices go through the roof, the fact that the price of the biggest purchase Canadians make in their lives is not included in our inflation statistics makes it easy to see why many young people have expressed doubts about the accuracy of those figures. It is a struggle that Statistics Canada faces every day as it tries to sketch out with numbers an authentic picture of the reality Canadians experience. But Oxford fellow and bestselling author of Age of Discovery Chris Kutarna says the task is far more complicated than many statisticians like to admit. Kutarna worries that Statistics Canada's plan to plunge into the ocean of ""Big Data"" so beloved of retailers and credit card companies — described last week by chief statistician Anil Arora — will inevitably create bias in the results simply because we are measuring the wrong things.  ""One of the terrifying and most fundamental sources of risk is that we only consider what we're now measuring as real,"" said Kutarna, on the phone from London, England. For example, long-standing data sets built on debt, spending, prices and gross domestic product simply close the door on values such as family, respect, happiness and species extinction. ""There is far more that is real and not being measured than there is that is real and we are measuring it,"" said Kutarna. One practical example from his book is the failure of modern statistics to measure the value of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which, despite providing value to billions, adds less to GDP figures than the old Encyclopedia Britannica which reached far fewer people. In a recent speech, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, described an economy changing so fast that our statistical models fail to grasp it. Poloz paraphrased the Solow Paradox, the observation by economist Robert Solow that computers had led to an increase in productivity everywhere but in the statistics. Poloz suggested GDP is being understated by as much as two per cent. One example he offered was the way so many companies are distributing computer services to the cloud, turning whole computer divisions into a budget line item. ""How does StatCan deal with that?"" asked Poloz. Last week, Arora boasted to a gathering of the Empire Club that Statistics Canada was respected everywhere as a global leader, but he acknowledges it is constantly struggling to keep up with changing technology and the shifting understanding of how the world works. ""Look, that's what statistics is, right? To take what are evolving concepts, nebulous concepts, things that haven't even taken a lot of shape and then quickly try to turn them into numerics,"" said Arora in an interview. The statistics chief calls it a ""team sport"" where governments and individuals need to decide which of the millions and millions of things that could possibly be measured should be addressed by the some 5,000 employees at Statistics Canada. Their job, he says, is to bring scientific rigour to the process, so that the numbers are as accurate as possible. ""This is always going to be a journey,"" said Arora, adding that finding and incorporating into our figures what have so far been labelled intangibles may be a never-ending task.  Part of that journey that those employees are now undertaking is the attempt to mine the immense bodies of information embedded in Big Data, those traces of activity we leave behind when we do almost anything on the internet from buying to searching. Not only are they readily available for quick analysis but they reduce the employee hours required in traditional surveys.  ""Alternate sources of data are increasing exponentially and we have the technologies and the mechanisms to convert them to public good with high quality statistics,"" said Arora in his speech. When it comes to the inadequacies of GDP, a big part of the problem has less to do with Statistics Canada than how we continue to use familiar indicators that may be out of date. Arora says the University of Waterloo's Canadian Index of Wellbeing includes 200 indicators — from crime and safety to sustainable growth — most of which come from Statistics Canada data. But it's GDP that gets the attention. Statisticians are always groping to find the data sets that matter. But even in areas we think we know and understand, statistics are merely an indicator — an estimate, of reality. Things we don't understand are, by definition, even harder to measure. ""We live in this culture where what is real is what we measure,"" said Kutarna, ""That the things we measure are reality.""

The animals were among 35 dogs found Dec. 10 living in what the SPCA called ""unsanitary conditions."" At a hearing held Dec. 30, witnesses described seeing dogs living in crates, soaked in urine, with matted fur, dental issues and worms. Some of the animals had severe behavioural issues, including anxiety and extreme fear of humans. The animal welfare agency has already found homes for the breeder's Jack Russell terriers, but many of the border collies needed extra training and socialization before they could be placed in new homes. Sandra Flemming, the SPCA's director of animal care, said the dogs have been through several weeks of intensive rehabilitation. ""They're very sweet dogs,"" she said. ""The best thing about them is that they're not aggressive when they're scared — they just kind of shut down."" The SPCA is looking for homes outside of urban centres because the dogs could be startled by traffic and other stimuli. Applicants must also: The agency says other criteria that are beneficial, but not required, include: Flemming said applicants will need to give the dogs lots of positive reinforcement and give them time to settle in. ""Just to be patient is the probably the biggest thing and to know that you're going to have some great days and then you're going have some some setbacks."" Those who end up adopting the pups will receive ongoing assistance from the SPCA. ""Taking them home doesn't mean you're on your own. These are dogs that we probably will have in our family for quite a little while. And anything that people that bring them home need, we're going to help them with that."" Karin Robertson, the original owner of the dogs, is facing charges of failing to comply with orders in relation to bringing the environment of the animals up to minimum standards and for causing an animal to be in distress through her actions. Robertson has said the dogs were always cared for, fed and loved.

After moving to Victoria from Saskatchewan where Hughes was a senior judge, he changed the course of politics and public life in B.C. ""It's a loss for our city and for the country,"" said Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps. Hughes served as B.C.'s first conflict of interest commissioner, from 1990 to 1997, and also served as chief adjudicator for an alternative dispute resolution process involving survivors of abuse in Canada's residential school system from 2003 to 2008. He also served as conflict of interest commissioner for the Northwest Territories and Yukon. In addition, he led numerous investigations and commissions including one in 2005 that followed the violent death of a child in foster care. His work led to the establishment of the Office of the Representative for Children and Youth. The Representative’s Office is deeply saddened to hear of the death of the Hon. Ted Hughes. Our sincere condolences to his family. Mr. Hughes’ report on BC’s child welfare system led to the creation of the RCY. A great and wise man. My condolences to Helen and the family of Ted Hughes. His integrity, belief in the importance of public service and wise counsel will be deeply missed. JC Hughes may best be remembered for forcing the resignation of Premier Bill Vander Zalm. Soon after his appointment as Conflict of Interest Commissioner in 1991, Hughes accepted the task of investigating the conduct of Vander Zalm in connection with the sale of his theme park outside Vancouver to Tan Yu, a Taiwanese businessman. Hughes found that the premier had arranged a meeting with the finance minister and a luncheon with the B.C. Lieutenant Governor for Yu, receiving an envelope full of cash from the buyer. In his report, Hughes concluded that Vander Zalm mixed his personal business with the public interest throughout the negotiation and sale, in violation of his own conflict of interest guidelines.  ""Hughes just did a meticulously thorough report, laid out all the facts, and said the premier is guilty of conflict of interest and that was the word,"" said Les Leyne, the Victoria Times Colonist's political columnist. ""He delivered the word, everybody accepted it. The premier quit about three or four days after the report landed."" While Hughes's reputation spread, along with demand for his services as an inquiry commissioner, his wife Helen Hughes entered municipal politics in Victoria. She served 18 years as a city councillor and took on volunteer roles.  Saanich councillor Susan Brice first met Hughes back in 1988 while she was the mayor of Oak Bay when he invited her to join a review of B.C.'s justice system. ""I have felt probably over the last 25 to 30 years he might be one of the most significant Canadian figures who was called upon to review huge social issues,"" said Brice. ""We are all grieving, we know it was a life well-lived."" Brice says Hughes had been in hospital over the last few weeks with declining health. For their public service, both Ted and Helen were appointed members of the Order of Canada and received honorary doctorates from the University of Victoria. Ted Hughes also held honorary degrees from the University of Saskatchewan and Royal Roads University, and has been awarded numerous accolades for his volunteer work. He acted as chair for the Saskatoon City Hospital board of governors, the Saskatchewan Cancer Foundation, Juan de Fuca Hospitals in Victoria and the Vancouver Island CNIB capital fundraising drive. Hughes served terms as president of the Saskatchewan Health Care Association and the Canadian Hospital Association. He also advocated for homeless people in Victoria, acting in 2008 and 2009 with the mayor of Victoria as co-chair of the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness.

200,Anonymous,2020-01-20T21:25:54.094Z,Woman who says she was raped at 15 on way to Sask. residential school denied settlement for 4th time,"A woman who alleges she was raped at age 15 while being transported to a residential school in Saskatchewan has had her settlement claim rejected for a fourth time — a case Ontario New Democrat MP Charlie Angus says highlights major gaps in the settlement agreement for survivors. The woman, whose identity is protected by the process, alleges that in 1971 a man who worked as a guidance counsellor for the federal Department of Indian Affairs Department, as it was then called, told her it was his job to take her to St. Michael's Indian Residential School in Duck Lake, Sask., about 85 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon. She says the man sexually assaulted her while they were on their way to the school. The case was filed under the independent assessment process created through the wider Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement to adjudicate individual claims of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and to determine compensation. Last week, a B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled her claim falls outside the scope of the agreement, because the woman was not yet enrolled at residential school at the time of the alleged sexual assault, and because the accused was not an employee of the school. She further noted the alleged assault did not happen on school property. In rendering this decision, the judge upheld three earlier rulings that came to the same conclusion. In her ruling, B.C. Supreme Court Justice B.J. Brown called the case and its outcome ""troubling,"" but noted that she is not precluded from pursuing a claim ""through other means."" Angus called the case ""appalling,"" and the judge's position ""ridiculous."" Angus says he believes it's part of a pattern of tactics used to block some residential school survivors from receiving compensation. He cited multiple cases of claims that have been denied over the years, including those brought by former students of St. Anne's residential school in Fort Albany, Ont. ""What we have seen time and time and time again is a government willing to use the endless resources of the justice department to wage a toxic legal war against the legal rights of survivors,"" Angus told reporters Monday in Ottawa. He is calling on Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett to intervene in this particular case and immediately award compensation to the woman. But he also says a parliamentary committee should conduct a broader review of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. ""We may never know how much of these cases were falsely adjudicated. I think a fair thing, now that this process is coming to an end, would be to learn lessons from it,"" he said. According to the latest statistics available on the Indian residential schools adjudication secretariat's website, as of Dec. 31, a total of 99 per cent of the over 38,000 claims filed have been resolved. Only 13 claims remain in progress, nine of which are at the post-hearing stage.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/cp-woman-claim-raped-sask-residential-school-1.5433801,[],[]
201,Adam Hunter,2020-01-21T00:06:15.057Z,Regina man with long-term offender designation for child porn back on trial with new name,"Gabriel Michael Fisher is on trial facing child pornography charges, his first trial under his new name. Fisher, 50, formerly known as Kevin Daniel Hudec, was charged in March 2018 with possessing and making child pornography, following an investigation by the Saskatchewan Internet Child Exploitation (ICE) Unit.  Two years earlier, under his old name, Fisher received a long-term offender designation after being convicted of child porn-related offences. Fisher's name change was listed in the Saskatchewan Gazette on March 2, 2018 — while he was under investigation, and just weeks before he was arrested on the charges currently before the court.  The Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice is considering changing the law to ban sex offenders from changing names. Fisher is charged with accessing, possession and making child pornography and failing to comply with an order prohibiting him from accessing child pornography. The investigation into the current charges began after a concerned phone call from officials at the Oskana Community Correctional Centre in Regina. Court heard on Monday, Fisher was making and receiving phone calls there in 2017, and officials were concerned about the potential subject matter, so they called ICE. Const. Peter Froh of the Regina Police Service working for ICE was given the case and began his investigation in January 2018.  Froh told the court Fisher was using a phone system known as Interactive Male. Froh said Fisher could leave and hear messages from other users. Froh had transcriptions and recordings of the conversations made, which were submitted as evidence. The Agreed Statement of Facts describes Interactive Male as a telephone service for men over 18 years of age.  Users can record a greeting which helps them connect with other users. The court heard a recording of Fisher's greeting, in which he describes his interests as ""foot fetish, young girls and taboo."" He invites others with similar interests to contact him. The service allows for live chat or recorded messages. Froh said the service's purpose was ""predominantly sexual."" Froh said Fisher's account made 346 calls using Interactive Male. He said the account was created using a credit card in June 2017. In one call, Fisher speaks with a man known as Jeff, who Froh later determined was in Michigan. In the conversation, Froh said ""Jeff"" discussed his 10-year-old daughter. This prompted Froh to contact the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Froh was asked by the Crown to read or describe the details of three messages received by Fisher from unidentified users. In two messages, one man describes a sexual assault of a person under the age of 10. In a third message, the sender described a sexually explicit act involving a child. Froh said he believed all three a constituted child pornography by definition in the criminal code of Canada. The crown closed its case on Monday. The defence will present its case in June.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-man-child-porn-trial-1.5433507,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/48-year-old-regina-man-facing-several-child-pornography-charges-1.4600203 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/david-donald-stryker-moves-to-regina-1.5418126,/news/canada/saskatchewan/48-year-old-regina-man-facing-several-child-pornography-charges-1.4600203 /news/canada/saskatchewan/david-donald-stryker-moves-to-regina-1.5418126
202,Sarah Morin,2020-01-20T21:37:40.072Z,Loss of youth centre the latest blow to Hillsborough,"After losing its bank and grocery store, the village of Hillsborough is about to suffer another loss.  The Hillsborough Drop In centre, which offers free services for kids aged 10 to 17, will close at the end of February because of a lack of funding.  The centre offers youth in the area a safe place to hang out and relax on week days after school from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Lynda Carey, the executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Riverview, which runs the program, said she's concerned about what the loss will mean for the community of 1,200 people and what the kids will do for fun once the program closes. ""Before we came, the village did indicate that there was a significant number of RCMP calls for mid-afternoon, late afternoon vandalism and mischief,"" Carey said, adding that those calls weren't happening a year later.  ""I'm afraid that if we're not there, this sort of might reappear."" The two-storey centre in Hillsborough, about 24 kilometres south of Riverview, began offering a variety of programs six years ago. They include physical recreation, planned trips, foosball, video games, cooking, arts and crafts, homework space and computer access for children and teens. Children and teens from Hillsborough, Hopewell Cape and Riverside-Albert use the program. About 75 kids are enrolled in the program this year, as of the beginning of January.  ""For some events, we've had up to 50 kids in that building because it's something that they're really looking forward to doing,"" Carey said. On quieter days, six or seven kids still go to the building to work on homework.  The Riverview Boys and Girls Club gets 90 per cent of its funding from local grants, but about $30,000 was cut in December. Carey said $30,000 is half what's needed to run the Hillsborough centre. ""When you lose that kind of money … it's hard to think how are you going to find that in such a short period of time, but we're hopeful.""  The Riverview Boys and Girls Club has an operating budget of $865,000. That money is divided among 12 programs run by the club, including the Hillsborough centre.  Carey said it seems like there are more non-profit organizations in the greater Moncton area and only so much money to go around, so she understands why a donor may have wanted to support another non-profit this year.  A town hall meeting will take place Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the centre, at 61 Academy St. in Hillsborough, to talk about its future.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/hillsborough-drop-in-centre-closes-1.5433032,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/hillsborough-grocery-store-closing-1.5340821,/news/canada/new-brunswick/hillsborough-grocery-store-closing-1.5340821

The two thieves dressed in black stole $4,000 worth of hand tools used for off-road rescues, such as accidents involving snowmobiles, boats and four-wheelers.  ""Our service hasn't been compromised any,"" Greg Williams, fire chief of the Debec Fire Department, said Monday. ""It's just going to take us a little bit longer."" Williams said his fire department can respond to one or two off-road rescues a year. The break-in happened shortly before 4 a.m. on Wednesday. The trailer sits next to the fire hall in Debec, about 15 kilometres southwest of Woodstock. Security footage shows a four-door sedan stopping in front of the trailer. Then a passenger gets out, and the car takes off. Williams said the thief used a hand tool to pry the open the door of the trailer. On the video, the car returns a few minutes later and the passenger throws a number of items into the backseat of the car. Then the passenger returns to the trailer and grabs more items. The individual gets back into the vehicle again, and the car takes off. ""It was kind of disappointing to say the least,"" Williams said.  The tools were shared by volunteer fire departments in North Lake, Meductic, Canterbury and Debec.  The local departments raised the money to buy the equipment. Williams said the fire departments will be able to pay for new equipment because they have theft insurance.   Williams assumes thieves stole the equipment to make some quick cash or pay down debt.  ""They'll truck it up to Quebec City or somewhere up there and then sell it,"" he said. ""Get them [stolen items] out of the province."" Williams said break-ins have become a problem in the area in recent months. ""There's been quite a few thefts around Woodstock, Debec, Hartland area."" Two men from Lower Knoxford, a community about 45 kilometres north of Woodstock, were arrested the day after the Debec fire department break-in. The two men, ages 26 and 29, were charged in connection with an investigation into a rash of thefts that started in December of last year. The thefts happened in Woodstock, Centreville, Lower Knoxford and Florenceville-Bristol. The RCMP didn't say if the Debec thefts would be among the charges. In a news release, police said members of the Woodstock and Perth-Andover RCMP detachments, along with the West District RCMP's Crime Reduction Unit, executed a search warrant. During the search, police recovered some property, including two side-by-sides, two all-terrain vehicles, firearms, chainsaws and various tools.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/debec-volunteer-fire-department-break-in-1.5433348,[],[]

206,Éric Blais,2020-01-17T13:13:50.397Z,6 ways the Conservatives could shake things up to widen their political appeal,"This column is an opinion by Éric Blais, president of Headspace Marketing in Toronto. He has helped build brands for more than 35 years and is a frequent commentator on political marketing, most recently on CBC's Power & Politics. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Business leaders dread them. They are set off by almost anything — competition, new regulations, changes in technology — and they force a company to adapt or fall by the wayside. Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel and a brilliant strategist, called them ""strategic inflection points"" and argued that, if managed right, these decisive moments can be an opportunity to win and emerge stronger than ever. The Conservative Party of Canada is now facing its own strategic inflection point. Political parties are complex creatures, and political brands are equally complex to build and manage. Therefore, battle-tested political strategists tend to rely on what they view as proven strategies and tactics. However, the Conservatives lost an election many thought they should have won, and they're now in search of a new leader. If ever there was a time the party should avoid doing the same thing while expecting a different outcome, this would be it. And in the course of trying something different, those political strategists could benefit from some marketing advice. WATCH | Power and Politics host Vassy Kapelos speaks to Éric Blais and ​​​​Dennis Matthews, a conservative strategist and vice-president at Enterprise Canada, about a potential fresh strategy for the Conservatives: The leadership race officially started this week. Don't just pick a leader. Pick a spokesperson with impeccable communications skills who is fluent in Canada's two official languages. Someone with strong name recognition and the gravitas to be the next prime minister. There isn't time for a Joe Clark to go from obscurity — Joe Who? — to prime minister. Even more importantly, don't let the leadership race influence the party policies that will be required to win over Liberal voters. Get those right, and do it now. If you don't, you risk hiring the wrong spokesperson (a blue, red or pink Tory) who will come across as inauthentic during the next election. Listen to new voices. There's a reason most organizations hire outside consultants for objective, fact-based advice: they usually tell it like it is. The party brand is seen as ""closed,"" according to a recent survey by Abacus Data. It's time to open it up to new thinking. The Conservative base of core supporters is solid, but not large enough in Ontario and Quebec to win the next election. So spend less time preaching to the converted who won't have anywhere to go even if they don't like some of the more progressive policies required to attract Liberal voters. Andy Grove was also known for his ability to ""look forward and reason back."" Take a page from his playbook and adapt the Conservative brand's promise to a changing Canada, while remaining true to the principles of conservatism. The next election will be about shaking loose Liberal supporters who are restless for something new. Please, don't use a slogan like ""Change you can trust."" Find something inspirational about the kind of change you'll bring to people's lives. Start a movement based on shared hope. Invite Canadians to vote for you because you're the better option, not because you're the one they distrust or dislike the least. And don't call them taxpayers. Pick a slogan and stick to it. Why wait until an election is called to express simply and concisely what you're about? Just do it. Permanent campaigning is a reality we can't escape. You might as well begin communicating what the party stands for even before the leader is elected in June. It will have the added benefit of making party members understand the Conservative strategy before choosing the right spokesperson. And stop being so negative. Many advertisers know they're wasting half their budget, they just don't know which half. There's a good chance the Conservatives wasted the large portion of their budget that was spent on relentless attack ads. That kind of ad worked against Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, but voters appear to have accepted that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised and still re-elected him. You've made your point. Run contrast ads during the next campaign but, in the meantime, focus your advertising on communicating your party's rebranding and on introducing the team, not just the new leader. Everyone marvels at the possibility of micro-targeting to reach specific groups of voters with a specific, tailored message. It's absolutely necessary as long as you have reliable data. But what will be equally important leading up to the next election is a plan to win votes in the Québécois nation — incidentally, a term used by Stephen Harper in a motion approved by the House of Commons in 2006. It may rattle some in Western Canada, but it's the only clear path the Conservative party has to form the next government.

207,Anonymous,2020-01-20T13:37:03.699Z,Impassable road leaves Elliston house to burn after blizzard,"Snow-covered roads blocked the path of firefighters in Elliston on Saturday morning, and left a home to burn in the community. Bonavista Mayor John Norman — whose fire department also serves Elliston — said firefighters responded to the call near the peak of the storm on Saturday morning, and couldn't make it to the fire in the nearby community in time. ""Elliston is about five minutes away, but municipal and provincial roads were completely impassable for emergency vehicles at the height of the storm,"" he told CBC Radio's Newfoundland Morning.  ""We could not reach the fire successfully, and the home was a complete loss."" Despite the help of a snowplow, Norman said, there was a similar challenge with calls for an ambulance during the storm. ""Thankfully, during the storm, they were not severe calls of a very extreme or serious nature. But attempts to reach one home in particular during the storm with plows and ambulance failed."" Elliston's deputy mayor, Geraldine Baker, said when firefighters eventually arrived, the house was almost totally destroyed, and neighbouring houses were in danger as well. She said the two people living inside the burnt-out home got out safely, and have been offered a place to stay in rental accommodations in the town. Baker complimented the firefighters and plow drivers for their work during the challenging situation. The Town of Bonavista declared a state of emergency Friday afternoon, during the storm. Winds gusted to 164 km/h during the weekend, and waves broke over the seawall that protects land in Bonavista. Norman called the damage to the seawall ""the most notable damage, and those that had me up and concerned for many hours, making lots of calls."" ""In some cases, significant land lost. Ten, 12, up to 15 feet of land has disappeared in this one storm,"" he said.  ""So of course I've been sending out messages to those government offices looking for some provincial and federal support as quickly as possible on the engineering issues around that.""  The sea spray also covered several homes, and the water froze into ice on some. Norman said the seawall was breached in six different places, and estimated the cost of repairs at more than a million dollars. He said he was looking for federal government to help pay for the damages.

209,Marcy Cuttler,2020-01-17T04:41:29.014Z,'It was shocking because it came so quick': Patients and doctors cope as flu season ramps up,"Packed emergency wards, filled with feverish, coughing people suffering from the flu. It is a scene being played out at hospitals across the country. This flu season started a bit earlier than normal and is now moving into high gear, experts say.  That certainly seemed clear at Humber River Hospital in Toronto on Boxing Day.  ""We saw 510 people come through our emergency room department and our after-hours kids clinic on that day,"" said Dr. Tasleem Nimjee, an ER physician at the hospital. What may also be a bit unusual is the presence of both flu strains at the same time. Influenza A mainly affects older people, while influenza B typically targets children and youth. Normally, one strain wanes as the other peaks. Every year, the flu kills an estimated 3,000 Canadians, often young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma. So far, there have been nearly 12,500 confirmed cases of flu across Canada and 10 deaths. In Manitoba, two families are reeling from the recent deaths of their loved ones. Joanne Ens, 24, died from a bacterial infection after battling the flu for several days, while Blaine Ruppenthal, 17, also died of complications from the flu. It's that toll on the body exacted by the flu that worries doctors. ""The flu can complicate pre-existing heart disease, asthma, chronic lung disease, quite often it causes pneumonia and that's sort of its route of causation. It's what makes people really sick,"" said Dr. Mark Loeb, division director for infectious diseases at McMaster University in Hamilton. WATCH | Q&A: Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr. Theresa Tam answered your questions about the flu In Ajax, Ont., about 50 kilometres east of Toronto, Wendy Wilson is recovering from a bout of pneumonia that left her with a cracked rib. It started with a sore throat and flu-like symptoms. ""I was afraid to walk fast or move too fast because it was like all of a sudden, I'd start coughing, and I'm feeling like I can't catch my breath,"" she said. ""It was shocking because it came so quick."" And those symptoms can sometimes worsen, Nimjee said. ""If somebody is really short of breath and not able to manage without assisted support, without oxygen or hydration or need antibiotics through an IV, those would be the people who would be admitted to hospital,"" she said. Yet experts say it's still too early to gauge the severity of this particular flu season. While doctors at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention point to ominous signs, such as widespread flu activity and hospitalizations, as indicators of a bad year, Canadian numbers, so far, don't bear that out. ""Based on data up to January 4, 2020, the Public Health Agency of Canada would not characterize the current flu season as severe at this time,"" officials told CBC News in an emailed response to questions. Loeb agreed it's too early to tell. Typically, flu season runs from mid-November until April. ""Flu epidemics are like a mountain. It's like an ascension and then you reach a peak and then you descend. Now we're on the ascension of that mountain and we don't know exactly where it will peak."" However, doctors agree on one thing: get the flu shot. Although this year's vaccine may not be a perfect match to the current strains, some protection is always better than none, according to Loeb. ""Sometimes prevention is harder for people to understand than treatment.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-pneumonia-1.5428093,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/grade-12-student-winnipeg-dies-complications-influenza-1.5425612 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cold-flu-myths-1.5400752,/news/health/cold-flu-myths-1.5400752 /news/canada/manitoba/grade-12-student-winnipeg-dies-complications-influenza-1.5425612 /news/canada/sudbury/sudbury-doctor-sam-oommen-flu-season-sick-kids-1.5421277
210,Anonymous,2020-01-16T19:17:43.983Z,"Harvey Weinstein trial: 5 jurors in, model Gigi Hadid out","Harvey Weinstein's lawyers went to court Thursday with a last-minute demand to halt jury selection and move his rape trial out of New York City, where they say intense media coverage, protesters and even the consideration of supermodel Gigi Hadid as a juror have turned the case into a ""media and entertainment circus."" Weinstein's lawyers detoured to the Manhattan appellate court hours after the 24-year-old Hadid was dismissed from the jury pool and as jurors were starting to be picked for the case. By lunchtime Thursday, five jurors had been selected — three men and two women — from about 145 potential jurors who were invited back for additional questioning. ""The deluge of publicity adverse to Mr. Weinstein has engulfed the potential jury pool resulting in untoward pressure upon jurors to convict a man demonized and prejudged guilty,"" Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala wrote in court papers that spurred Thursday's trip to the appellate court. Prosecutors oppose moving the trial, pointing to the plethora of potential jurors still in the running after pledging they could be fair and impartial as evidence that the process is working. Moving to a smaller community with a smaller jury pool would only make it more difficult to find jurors, they added. The appellate court did not immediately rule. The matter will go to a panel of judges with the aim of having a decision before opening statements, which could happen as early as midweek next week. Weinstein, 67, is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another in 2006. He has pleaded not guilty and said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, Weinstein could face life in prison. Aidala, in his court papers seeking to move the trial, said a ""media and entertainment circus"" has taken hold in the eight days of jury selection. He cited ""flash mob"" protests in the streets whose chants and banging from pots and pans could be heard in the courtroom 15 stories up, some potential jurors flouting court rules and posting about their experiences on social media and the frenzy over Hadid's appearance in the jury pool. Hadid, 24, was spotted shortly before 9 a.m. walking into the courthouse trailed by a person resembling a bodyguard. Holding a black handbag in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, Hadid didn't say anything as she disappeared into a room. A few minutes later, she shook hands with a court officer and left the courthouse. Court officials confirmed she was cut from the list of potential jurors, an expected development following the attention her presence in court generated. Hadid, a Victoria's Secret model, caused a stir Monday when she emerged as a potential juror, telling the judge she had met Weinstein but could be impartial. She also said she had met actress Salma Hayek, a potential witness. Despite Hadid's insistence that she could ""keep an open mind on the facts,"" the defence and prosecutors later agreed that having her on the jury would be too much of a commotion. Judge James Burke has said he expects a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates to be seated in time for opening statements and testimony next Wednesday. He told prospective jurors that he expected the trial to finish up in early March.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-hadid-jurors-winnowed-1.5429125,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5416747,/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-hadid-1.5426418 /news/entertainment/weinstein-recusal-rejected-1.5420656

212,"Katie Pedersen, Eric Szeto, Asha Tomlinson",2020-01-20T16:56:56.850Z,Nearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why.,"Like many new parents, Meggan Larson was anxious to learn everything she could about keeping her kids healthy. So, she joined community groups and forums on Facebook, hoping to learn the ins and outs of healthy living as she navigated her new role as a parent. What she found instead were piles of warnings about vaccines. ""It seemed like everywhere I looked, there was [a post about] another child being injured by vaccines — and not a child getting polio,"" she said. ""It was definitely convincing."" As a result, Larson became ""vaccine hesitant."" Unlike strident anti-vaccination activists known as ""anti-vaxxers,"" those who are ""vaccine hesitant"" don't consider themselves against vaccination necessarily; they are just unsure about the safety and/or efficacy of vaccines. The number of vaccine-hesitant parents worldwide is growing. Last year, the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy a Top 10 threat to global health. ""You just kind of go down a rabbit hole of information,"" said Larson. ""It seemed like the more you clicked on links that people would post, the more stories you would see. And it just seemed so loud."" WATCH | CBC Marketplace's Asha Tomlinson is joined by associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health Dr. Vinita Dubey, answering your questions on vaccinations and myths. Have a question? Ask on YouTube here: About half of Canadians have some level of hesitancy, according to the Wellcome Global Monitor, a survey by a U.K.-based health foundation that looks at global confidence in immunization. In its latest 2018 survey, only 53 per cent of Canadians chose ""strongly agree"" when presented with the statement ""vaccines are safe"" while 58 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are effective"" and 76 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are important."" Marketplace sifted through studies and arguments, examined anti-vaccination documentaries and attended an anti-vaxx rally in Washington, D.C., to get a sense of the information being distributed. The team also spoke with more than a dozen vaccine-hesitant and anti-vaxx Canadians and heard from many more via email. Many of the arguments and scientific studies seemed reasonable, so Marketplace ran them by specialists. Journalists further consulted with toxicologists, vaccinologists, microbiologists, psychologists and academics throughout this investigation, all of whom confirmed the safety and efficacy of vaccines. So, why does anti-vaxx messaging remain so effective at sowing doubt? Some experts point to our cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that help us understand and remember information. The way that misinformation is disseminated on social media manipulates us — intentionally or not — into wanting to believe it. Dr. Olivier Drouin, a Montreal pediatrician with a background in behavioural psychology, sees these biases at play with parents of his patients. ""They just care deeply about their child, and so those cognitive biases are amplified,"" he said. One bias that vaccine misinformation plays on is our omission bias, or our tendency to prefer inaction over action when we are faced with potential negative consequences, because we will feel less personally responsible for the outcome. Larson says she can relate. ""For me, the worry is paralyzing initially because I don't want to hurt my kids,"" she said. Larson said the misinformation she'd read was convincing, so she was delaying making a decision about vaccination until she felt more sure. ""My kids will be fine for now while I figure out what I'm going to do,"" she recalls thinking. ""And the years just go by — and suddenly, you have a five-year-old who's never had a single vaccine."" Another bias that makes us susceptible to misinformation is our identifiable victim bias, or our tendency to feel more connected to the emotional story of a single victim, rather than a larger cause backed by statistics. If a charity wants to inspire people to donate to its cause, for example, it might tell the story of a single victim rather than explaining why a cause is important through figures and facts. Even though she'd seen the statistics proving the benefits of vaccines, Larson said the individual horror stories were more impactful and sowed doubt. ""I was like, 'Gosh, this is happening all the time, I can't do this to my children,'"" she said. Much of the anti-vaccination information spread online is anecdotal. When parents come to Drouin with doubts about vaccines, he says, they often start with an anecdote they read or a video they saw. ""They always start with the story of somebody — either a celebrity, or some relative, or their hairdresser, or somebody in their environment who had a personal story — so they feel that connection,"" he said. ""I think that's one of the strongest biases I see when it comes to vaccinations."" Another big issue, Drouin says, is a bias called probability neglect, or our tendency to disregard numbers when there's a highly emotional potential outcome — even an extremely unlikely one. ""If I'm with my patient, and I speak about the risk of [requiring] a transfusion, for example, it's one in a million. Well, you know, they're not listening to the number,"" said Drouin. His patients immediately start to worry about their child having to be in the ICU and being really sick, he said. ""The minute I mention the risk, it's forgotten,"" he said. ""They're focusing on the vividness of the image it brings to mind."" The bigger the number, the harder it is to put into context, he says. ""What is one in a 100,000 versus a one in a million chance? Like, it's really kind of a strange number to think about,"" he said. ""We don't even really have context about what it means, even though something might be 100 times more likely."" Larson says she struggled with the numbers even after she had decided to vaccinate. ""It was still scary because I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I hope they're not the one in a gazillion who is going to have some horrific reaction,"" she said. So, what convinced Larson to vaccinate? She had started questioning the rhetoric behind the information she was reading and was talking to her doctor about it. ""I started clicking on the sources that anti-vaccine campaigns were linking [to] and realized that most of them were garbage,"" she said. The scientific studies were not the hard evidence she thought they were. ""Once you actually followed it to the conclusion, it didn't actually state at all what [the messaging] said it did."" WATCH | Meggan Larson's children, along with her sister's kids, came down with whooping cough: Just when she was about to book an appointment to vaccinate, Larson's unvaccinated niece came down with whooping cough — and it quickly spread to all five of her niece's siblings, as well as to Larson's three kids. It was a scary reminder of how contagious many vaccine-preventable diseases are, she said. ""Coming across someone with whooping cough or polio, I mean, you're going to get it, it's a miracle if you don't."" All of Larson's kids fully recovered and have since been vaccinated, along with the children of her her sister, Tara Hills. Hills spoke out about vaccine misinformation back in 2015, but it has taken Larson four years to go public about her experience. ""The only reason that I wanted to share my story is because I don't want people to sit in fear anymore,"" she said. Here are some of the most pervasive concerns Canadians have about vaccines, and why experts say we shouldn't worry about them: It's true that vaccines contain chemicals that would be considered toxic at very high doses. But so does pretty much everything humans interact with daily. Even water is toxic in high enough quantities. Although the idea of a ""chemical"" may sound harmful, everything we eat can be broken down into its chemical makeup. A banana, for example, contains dozens of chemical compounds. The vaccine ingredients that most people are concerned about — mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum — are present in very small, non-toxic quantities. Mercury was previously used as a preservative in some vaccines in the form of thimerosal. It was one of the first ingredients that parents took issue with, and there was so much public concern that it was removed from almost all vaccines, despite the fact that it never existed in quantities that would be considered problematic. Vaccines only ever contained 50 micrograms of thimerosal (equal to 25 micrograms of mercury) per 0.5 millilitre dose. For comparison, that's about the same amount of elemental mercury in a three-ounce can of tuna. Nowadays, mercury only exists in certain types of flu shots. Formaldehyde is another ingredient often of concern. There is only between 0.1 mg and 0.003 mg of formaldehyde in a single dose, depending on the vaccine. Compare that to a 200-gram pear, which contains 12 mg of formaldehyde, or 120 times as much. Formaldehyde is actually a chemical that your body creates itself as part of the metabolic process. Aluminum is another ingredient people are concerned about. It is also found in very low quantities in vaccines for diseases such as HPV and hepatitis. Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food and water and breast milk. Keep in mind that very few vaccinations contain aluminum, and those that do, only contain 0.85 mg per dose. Compare that to 10-20 mg of aluminum in one tablet of buffered aspirin. Antacids can contain anywhere from 104 to 208 mg of aluminum per tablet, or more than 100 times more aluminum than any vaccine. The reason it is added to vaccines is because it helps create the immune response needed to develop immunity. Vaccines work by injecting a dead, weakened or partial version of the virus into the body so the immune system can learn what it looks like and how to fight it the next time it is encountered — before it gets deep within the body and causes physical harm. Adjuvants, like aluminum, make that dead virus look more threatening than it is in order to activate an immune response, prompting the body to learn how to fight the disease instead of immediately flushing it out. It is important to note that all traces of aluminum (and the rest of the ingredients in the vaccine) would still be flushed completely out of the body within a day or two, leaving behind only the lessons learned by your immune cells. The ingredients don't build up in the body, therefore, receiving many vaccines will not stack up the levels of aluminum or other ingredients. Learn more about aluminum and other adjuvants here. The claim that links vaccines and autism originates from a now-discredited 1998 study published in the prestigious Lancet medical journal by former gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield titled ""Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and pervasive developmental disorder in children."" There were 13 authors listed on the study, with Wakefield being the lead author. But in 2004, 10 authors retracted the interpretation of the study after ""serious allegations of research misconduct"" were brought to the attention of The Lancet, including allegations of biased selection of patients and unethical, invasive procedures. The journal also found Wakefield had unreported conflicts of interest, namely, that some of the research was funded by lawyers who were acting on behalf of parents suing vaccine manufacturers. As a result, Wakefield lost his medical licence. Many studies have since been done to test his hypothesis, but all scientifically reputable studies found no link. A 900-page analysis by the American Institute of Medicine (IOM) looked at all relevant studies and meta-analysis, finding that ""the mechanistic evidence regarding an association between MMR vaccine and autism is lacking."" This may sound like the science is simply insufficient, but microbiologist Jocelyn Srigley explained that in scientific terms, ""lacking"" is tantamount to saying evidence is not just weak, but absent altogether. The biggest and most recent study looking for a correlation between vaccines and autism followed 657,461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 2013. This study compared MMR-vaccinated with unvaccinated children and found ""no increased risk for autism."" This study even looked at sub-factors, such as sibling history of autism, autism risk factors or other childhood vaccinations to see if those factors could combine with a vaccine to create a higher risk. But again, it found no increased risk. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a profitable industry, but vaccines are not big money-makers compared to other drugs. Only two to three per cent of the global pharmaceutical profits come from vaccines, despite the fact that most people on earth are vaccinated. In fact, most childhood vaccines have expired patents, and it's estimated that once a generic drug enters the market after a patent expiration, name-brand sales drop by 80 per cent. Physicians often lose money on the administration of vaccines, and some governments have to incentivise drug companies to keep making them because of the fact that the profit margins are so low. Vaccines take lots of time and money to develop because the regulatory standards are higher than for other drugs since they are being injected into healthy people. They may make some money in the first few years, but they also have to carry the burden of cost for all the years of research and development. Vaccines prevent millions of people from getting seriously sick every year. If you're worried about motives, keep in mind that Big Pharma makes a lot more money off people who are sick than people whom vaccines have kept healthy. Even though we rarely encouter certain diseases anymore, such as pertussis or polio, they are only kept at bay because the vast majority of the population is vaccinated. If you talk to older generations, they'll tell you stories of their friends who became deaf, blind, disabled or died from the diseases that vaccines have eliminated in North America. In areas where vaccination rates drop past a certain threshold, we can see resurgence of these diseases, which can be picked up and brought back to countries that had virtually eliminated them. For example, Samoa had a significant drop in vaccination rates over the past few years due in part to anti-vaccination campaigns and an MMR scare after a nurse accidentally mixed up two shots with an expired anesthetic, resulting in two deaths. When measles made it into the community, it quickly infected thousands of people; 81 of those infected died, and almost all of them were babies and young children. Authorities arrested an anti-vaxxer for spreading misinformation during the epidemic while the government was frantically trying to get everyone vaccinated. The only disease that has been entirely eradicated worldwide is smallpox. This was because of a very effective mass-vaccination initiative in the 1960s that managed to drive the disease into extinction. Polio is a candidate for eradication, with only three endemic countries left. Until complete eradication is reached, vaccination is still necessary for highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Measles can live for two hours while airborne, which means if an unvaccinated person entered a room where someone with measles coughed an hour earlier, they would still be likely to catch the virus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccines-trust-1.5181208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955,/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805 /news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955 /news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 /news/health/measles-outbreak-cdc-1.5115953
213,Anonymous,2020-01-17T18:00:41.574Z,'I'm Indigenous and I'm proud of it': Cree comic inspires sons to follow in his footsteps,"When Howie Miller first started performing standup comedy more than 20 years ago, plenty of his jokes were at his own expense.  ""There used to be a huge amount of not only self-deprecation but also Indigenous deprecation,"" the Cree comic said. ""I wasn't doing it 100 per cent the way I wanted to because I didn't know how to do it."" Miller's stand-up routine, and daily conversations, still have moments of self-deprecation, but he picks his spots and is more measured. It's one of the many things Miller said his sons have taught him. One of them, Todd Houseman, is half the sketch comedy duo Folk Lordz, where the comedy intersects with politics, culture and being Indigenous in today's Canada. The comedy in Folk Lordz punches up and not down, Houseman said — a critical focus for him and his sketch comedy partner, Ben Gorodetsky. ""When you're talking about punching down, you're making jokes at the expense of a community that's already disempowered,"" Houseman said. ""Whereas punching up is making jokes at communities that already have more power or more social influence in today's climate."" While Houseman has been teaching his dad about how to navigate the political comedy waters more effectively, it was Miller who taught his sons a lot of what they know today. Miller hadn't planned on being a standup comedian, but as a young father, he needed to make money quickly. ""I had this ability to keep people's attention and do it in a humourous nature, so comedy just sort of fell into my lap,"" he said. From a young age, Houseman and his brothers were exposed to all sorts of comedy. Miller was the jokester in the house, and when he wasn't trying to make his sons laugh, he sat and watched shows like Monty Python with them. As his sons got older and his career a little more seasoned, Miller had his own sketch comedy show on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network called Caution: May Contain Nuts. The sketch show was tame, Miller said, but it allowed everyone in their family to try their hands at sketch — both in front of the camera and behind it. It was the absurdist comedy of Monty Python and the experience from Caution that inspired Houseman to pursue comedy in his own right.  It's one of Houseman's inspirations with Folk Lordz. He and Gorodetsky mix topical and political humour with absurdist notes that throw you for a loop as soon as you've got a feel for the message they're trying to convey. Miller even starred in a sketch in the first season of Folk Lordz, which is available on YouTube in its entirety. ""I removed a tooth for that bit,"" Miller said. That particular scene was one of a handful that didn't have to do with Indigenous issues. Both Houseman and Miller have goals of being comics and performers who happen to be Cree, and not just Cree performers. But a lot of comedy is derived from lived experiences, and they're both more than happy to work with what they've got, knowing it's not all that defines them. ""It's more of a pride thing, where it's like, 'Damn right I'm Indigenous and I'm proud of it.

214,Ashley Burke,2020-01-20T22:20:23.840Z,United Nations to review dangers of flying in conflict zones after deadly Iran crash,"The United Nations' aviation agency says it will review the issue of passenger planes flying in conflict zones in the wake of the Flight PS752 disaster that killed 176 people, including 57 Canadians.  In a rare move, a team with the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), including four Canadians, has also joined the safety investigation into the Ukrainian plane that was shot down by Iran on Jan. 8.  The tragedy raised questions about why passenger planes were allowed to take off in Iran while the military was on high alert after attacking bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops just hours earlier. At the time of the crash, Iran kept its airspace open. Ukraine and Ukraine International Airlines also didn't ground the plane.  It's up to countries dealing with conflict to close down their airspace. The onus is also on other countries and airlines to proactively complete their own risk assessment and decide whether it's safe to fly in the region, according to international aviation conventions.  ICAO confirmed to CBC News it will look into its conflict zone guidance and compliance once the investigation into the crash is complete.  ""All of this depends on the recommendations brought forward by the investigating states,"" ICAO spokesperson Anthony Philbin said in a statement to CBC News.  Iran invited ICAO to provide expert advice as part of the probe. The move came as pressure from the international community mounted for a thorough and transparent investigation into how and why Iran shot the passenger plane out of the sky. Four out of six senior and technical staff ICAO assigned to the case are based out of the agency's headquarters in Montreal. The team is advising and observing Iran's work to make sure its investigators comply with international requirements. ""Whether they may eventually be required to go to Iran will be up to the states they're assisting as things proceed,"" Philbin said of ICAO's experts.  They will also work directly with other countries involved in the investigation, including Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday he is encouraged ICAO is involved because its presence will help ""ensure that these situations no longer happen.""  There have  been six other cases since the 1980s where ICAO consulted on a deadly aviation crash.  More than 30 years ago, the agency had an advisory role after a U.S. navy ship missile shot down an Iran Air jetliner on its way to Dubai, killing all 290 people on board. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reminded the world about that 1988 crash in a tweet just days before Iran admitted it mistakenly shot down Flight PS752. Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IR655?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#IR655</a><br>Never threaten the Iranian nation. Other cases the UN agency monitored include:  More recently, ICAO consulted on the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Eastern Ukraine in July 2014. The crash killed 298 people, including one Canadian. The investigation found the plane was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian separatists. After MH17, the Dutch Safety Board followed up with a report about the risk of flying over conflict zones and found that countries with ongoing armed conflict are reluctant to close their airspace. The board concluded the aviation parties involved had not adequately recognized the risks of the armed conflict in the area. But it also found the current system of assessing risks associated with flying over conflict areas is ""in urgent need of improvement."" ICAO set up a special task force following the MH17 tragedy and created an online tool so countries could better share their conflict zone information. ""Airlines are required to conduct regular risk assessments along their route networks using all available information,"" according to the agency's website.  Kathy Fox, chair of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, was asked last week if the world went far enough implementing the recommendations, and she said no. She cited a warning included in the Dutch report: in countries where there is ""ongoing armed conflict,"" officials cannot be counted on to bar commercial airliners from the airspace on their own initiative.  ""They recognized, when this report was issued, that there were still potential gaps. And unfortunately, we're seeing the results of that,"" Fox said. ICAO has also made a series of updates to its international requirements because of the lessons learned from the shooting down of MH17. That work included improving its risk assessment manual on civil aircraft operations over or near conflict zones.  Countries have also endorsed a manual about safety measures related to military activities that could pose a danger to commercial airliners, as well as guidance on civil and military co-operation in air traffic management. However, these amendments won't come into effect until later this year. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-752-plane-crash-icao-joining-investigation-1.5432888,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ps752-flight-iran-missile-1.5422912 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tsb-plane-crash-iran-visit-1.5425971 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/aviation-authorities-want-better-risk-assessment-over-conflict-zones-1.2721550 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-justice-crash-ukranian-arrests-1.5426809,/news/world/ps752-flight-iran-missile-1.5422912 /news/world/iran-ukraine-plane-crash-black-boxes-1.5432476 /news/politics/tsb-plane-crash-iran-visit-1.5425971 /news/politics/kevin-mccarthy-trump-soleimani-iran-1.5426345 /news/world/iran-justice-crash-ukranian-arrests-1.5426809 /news/canada/edmonton/university-of-alberta-memorial-iran-1.5422971 /news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527
215,Steven Webb,2020-01-19T13:00:00.073Z,No place to play: Elite New Brunswick goalie fights for true women's pro league,"For New Brunswick's Marlène Boissonnault, playing for Team Canada's women's Olympic hockey team is the dream. But to get there, there's one big obstacle the former Cornell University goaltending star may have to overcome. She, like many other elite female hockey players, needs a place to play and develop. ""We're fighting for a game,"" Boissonnault said in an interview from Calgary. ""And, right now, we don't have the games or we don't have the competition that we need."" That's why the 22-year-old from Dundee, 14 kilometres southwest of Dalhousie, has joined the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association. The organization formed in the wake of the collapse of the only professional women's league in Canada. The Canadian Women's Hockey League folded in the spring of 2019, leaving the National Women's Hockey League in the U.S. as the only place for women to play, outside of college hockey. But the NWHL isn't a solution either. ""Most players were getting anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 [for] the whole year,"" said Boissonnault, ""which, when you look at the amount of time to put in there, and the sacrifices they had to do, was not acceptable whatsoever."" ""And they didn't have any health care or anything like that, which is something we are looking to get for our league in the future."" A viable professional women's league is the goal of the Professional Women's Hockey association, made up of 200 or so of the sport's best players, who all refuse to play so-called professional hockey until things improve. ""It's called a gap year, essentially, so all these players are getting together and fighting for what is right,"" Boissonnault said. ""I guess someone could call it a boycott, essentially fighting for better resources by deciding not to play this year in the league, or not to play in any league, until we have a viable league."" Boissonnault has been focused on hockey since she was a child growing up in northern New Brunswick, starting out playing at the age of four. By the time she had reached the novice level, for children under the age of nine, she had settled on being a goalie. It was a good decision. By high school, Boissonnault was starring in net for the girl's team at Rothesay Netherwood School.  She was invited to play for Canada's Under-18 national team in the 2015 world championships. She made 38 saves in a heartbreaking overtime loss to the U.S. in the finals, bringing home a silver medal. That's when Cornell University came calling. ""I got scouted by a few different universities and Cornell happened to be one of them,"" Boissonnault said. ""Cornell to me was just the best for my lifestyle and for what I wanted to do later, and obviously for the hockey side of things, hockey-wise it's one of the best in the NCAA."" Off the ice, she pursued a B.Sc. in biology, in preparation for going on to a medical degree. On the ice, she got a shot at a national championship in her senior year, known in the NCAA as the Frozen Four. ""There were obviously some ups and downs, just like any journey has, but obviously we ended up on a very good high.  We ended up going to the Frozen Four, finishing up as one of the best teams in the NCAA, that is, in the nation,"" she said. She finished her career with 56 wins, putting her second on Cornell's all-time list. Her 1.61 goals against average in her senior year led the conference, and placed her second in the nation. Naturally, with that kind of success, she was looking to continue her hockey career after graduation. ""I knew that there was a CWHL and NWHL that was there currently,"" Boissonnault said, ""I knew that, of course, it didn't have the benefit that you would hope for, but it was at least something that was there so I could further my career."" With the collapse of the CWHL, Boissonnault felt her best option was the Professional Women's Hockey Players AssociationPWHPA. The group has been arranging showcases across North America to get some of the sport's best players in front of fans. The latest was held in Toronto in the second week of January. ""So the one in Toronto basically was inviting all these players from Canada to try to play and make teams out of that,"" said Boissonnault. ""There were six teams for the weekend, six games, and yet it ended up being a great weekend, a weekend where we're trying to prove ourselves and show to the world that this is a game worth investing into and worth the time and the effort."" The PWHPA said the 700-seat arena was essentially sold out for all six games in Toronto.  But for Boissonnault, these showcase events can't replace the need to get into game situations against good competition. ""I mean, here in Calgary, we're playing exhibition games or scrimmages, however you want to call them, against Midget-AA boys or against boys from different teams because we don't have the competition or the money to afford to fly out to different places to play,"" she said. ""When you look at the national stage, the players, they need to play against each other and develop because, I mean, you want to play against the best to become the best, right?"" While the PWHPA tries to raise the profile of the women's game, and seeks sponsors to help get a true professional league off the ground, Boissonnault is also moving ahead on her Olympic dream. She has been invited to be part of Hockey Canada's National Development team but will have to compete with 10 other goalies to get a spot on Team Canada for the Beijing Olympics in 2022. ""I'm just playing and taking every day as being better than the day before,"" Boissonnault said. ""I mean it's not about seeing a deadline or seeing some sort of end date. ""It's more about always becoming better, so that whenever I do retire, whenever I do end my career, that I'm going to be able to say, 'Hey, I gave it all I've got. And I became the very best player I could be.'"" Until then, she hopes she and hundreds of other elite female hockey players in this country will find a place to play that includes more than a free roll of tape in the dressing room and ensure a future for the young women coming behind them. ""We are fighting for them to have a future and for them to be able to dream of playing hockey as a career and for the little girls to be able to have those people, those role models, to look up to."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/elite-nb-goaltender-olympics-1.5428573,[],/sports/hockey/nhl-all-star-game-women-3-on-3-event-pwhpa-1.5424705 /sports/hockey/dream-gap-tour-first-steps-toronto-1.5293228

The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) gave notice last Wednesday its members plan to walk off the job for a one-day strike on Mon., Jan. 20, in the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board and a few other boards in the Toronto area. The Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) has called a one-day strike for Tues., Jan. 21, in several school boards, including the Hastings and Prince Edward District School Board. Members of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) also plan a one-day strike on Tuesday. The City of Ottawa is again offering day camps at recreation centres across the city both Monday and Tuesday. These school boards would be affected without a last-minute deal or other change.  All English public elementary schools in Ottawa would close on Monday, Jan. 20. Classes would also be cancelled for students in Grades 7 and 8 who attend Bell, Earl of March, Longfields-Davidson Heights, Merivale and Sir Robert Borden high schools. All school buses for elementary students would be cancelled. The Extended Day Program would remain open for students who are already registered. All English Catholic schools in Ottawa would close on Tues., Jan. 21 if a strike by OECTA occurs. Before and after-school programs would be cancelled, but toddler and preschool programs and EarlyOn Centres for kids age six and under will run as normal. Exams will still start on Thursday as scheduled. All CDSBEO schools would close on Tues., Jan. 21 if a strike by OECTA occurs. Parents with children that attend child care or before- and after-school care programs in CDSBEO facilities should contact their individual provider for details on whether they will still operate during the strike. All ALCDSB schools would close on Tues., Jan. 21, if a strike by OECTA occurs. All RCDSB schools would close on Tues., Jan. 21, if a strike by OECTA occurs. ETFO has said their members plan to strike in Renfrew County on Tues., Jan. 21. The board has said it will close all schools as a result. Daycares and before- and after-school providers in schools will remain open. All secondary school classes would be cancelled on Tuesday, Jan. 21, if the planned strike by OSSTF goes ahead. Grade 9 to 12 students should not go to school that day. Students from junior kindergarten to Grade 8 would not be affected.  OSSTF workers at École secondaire publique Marc-Garneau and École élémentaire publique Cité-Jeunesse, both in Trenton, plan to strike on Tuesday, Jan. 21. The school board said these schools will close that day, including before- and after-school programs. OSSTF workers at École élémentaire catholique L'Envol, also in Trenton, plan to strike as well on Tuesday, Jan. 21.  The board said the school and its daycare programs will be closed that day.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/etfo-osstf-oecta-school-strikes-1.5428455,[],/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-ford-unions-what-need-know-1.5429092 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-oecta-1.5425273 /news/canada/toronto/etfo-public-teachers-strike-1.5427368 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-french-teacher-work-to-rule-1.5428910 /news/canada/ottawa/teachers-strike-osstf-ontario-ottawa-picket-1.5427678
217,Ainsley Hawthorn,2020-01-11T11:30:00.842Z,When every January is dry: The surprising appeal of living without alcohol ,"It's January, a month that many people now observe as 'Dry January' — a period to set aside alcohol and focus on health.  It's not something I will be observing as a special occasion, because I don't drink at all. I can't remember when I decided not to drink. It was before I turned 19, because my celebration didn't include the traditional first (legal) bar visit. It was before I started university, because I was able to enjoy being the only sober person at the end-of-orientation-week party, where I banked some wild stories to recount to my friends once they recovered from their hangovers. I had had the occasional sip of alcohol as a teenager, and I thought it tasted terrible. I never enjoyed the astringent kick of wine, the malty foulness of beer. But, honestly, who does? Alcoholic drinks taste objectively bad to most people at first. As the saying goes, you don't drink them for the taste, and it's likely that if alcoholic beverages were uncoupled from their euphoric effects we wouldn't drink them at all. The difference between me and most of my peers, I suppose, is that I wasn't enthusiastic enough about the idea of getting buzzed to push through the nasty flavour. My choice puzzled my friends at the time. After all, in our society we drink alcohol not only for its pleasurable effects but as a rite of passage. Alcohol is a symbol of our transition into adulthood, and most teenagers are anxious to enjoy adult freedoms and to prove themselves worthy of adult responsibilities. We indulge in alcohol furtively when we begin to feel suffocated by the authority of our parents and guardians. We partake in alcohol openly to celebrate when our numerical age makes us legally (if not actually) independent from them. When I declined a glass or bottle, I often found myself in the hot seat, being grilled on my reasons for abstaining. Not drinking, I've discovered, is one of the few purely personal choices that can make even strangers deeply uncomfortable. It's a singular experience to be questioned about why you don't drink alcohol, because there are a limited number of answers people consider legitimate. An illness, a religious doctrine, a family history of alcoholism — these seem to be acceptable explanations for abstaining. My reasons? I don't like the taste, I'm having a good time already, I just don't feel like it? These never seem to be good enough, so much so that I've sometimes fallen back on the excuse that there's been alcoholism in my family (which is true, but not a factor) just to cut these awkward conversations short. Why all this public concern over one aspect of my diet? I don't like spicy food or cilantro either, but no one interrogates me about that. Not drinking, on the other hand, is often taken as an affront. This is probably a legacy of the temperance movement, the organized crusade against alcohol consumption that snowballed during the 19th and early 20th centuries and eventually led to prohibition. The temperance movement took a moral stance against alcohol and portrayed drinkers as reckless libertines or hopeless degenerates. As a result, when you say you don't drink, even today, the people around you begin to wonder if you're looking down your nose at them like the temperance teetotallers of yore. Add to that the fact that our society considers alcohol essential for relaxing, socializing, and partying, and the non-drinker becomes a very suspicious animal indeed. Is she a puritanical square, the sworn enemy of all things fun? This heap of cultural baggage makes it difficult for each of us to untangle how we really feel about alcohol from how we're supposed to feel about it, how alcohol really affects our bodies from our expectations of how it should affect them. I know a number of moderate drinkers who've recently given up alcohol after realizing they don't actually enjoy drinking. Alcohol is a depressant. It can lower your inhibitions and relax you, but it can also dampen your mood and make you feel gloomier than you did before. If you're already prone to depression, drinking alcohol may not be a fantastic experience. Others quit drinking because it's getting in the way of their fitness goals (many alcoholic beverages are high in calories but, because they're liquids, don't fill you up) or because they want to save money. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians spend $1,056 per person on alcohol each year. Each of us deserves to assess for ourselves whether drinking works for us, our bodies, and our pocketbooks. So, I propose a reality-based reset of our society's approach to alcohol: Whether you'll be enjoying the occasional drink this month or having a dry January, just remember that, if you're of legal age, drinking is an option, not a requirement.

Dan Bobbett, mayor of Paradise, tweeted a warning to residents early Saturday morning: clearing over 75 centimetres of snow off town property will take time. Advice from all sides? Hole up, hunker down and wait, since there's nowhere to go anyway. Some Avalon residents have found uses for the nine- to 10-foot drifts blocking their doors, leaving them wondering how to tunnel out — and then, of course, how to stomp and flail their way through the drifts to get enough leverage to move the snow around. Others have given up entirely. On Saturday, CBC Radio's Cross Country Checkup opened the national phone lines to hear how Canadians across the country are coping with winter weather. Still snowed in, many callers from Newfoundland shared their stories. Sonja Mills of Port Rexton told host Duncan McCue that she and her wife, Alicia, are passing the time with marathon games of cribbage.  ""[We are] really just kind of hanging in there, hoping the power doesn't go out [and] getting prepared for it,"" Mills said. But the couple had a more pressing concern on their minds. As owners of Port Rexton Brewing Company, they strapped on skis Saturday afternoon and braved the weather to check on their beer. ""With the power on ... things are still happening in the brewing tanks, so we're going to go keep an eye on things,"" she told McCue. For Bob Cole, the legendary broadcaster who retired last year after a half-century of work for Hockey Night in Canada, it was a chance to give some old friends an update on what's happening in his home province. ""It took a state of emergency, by the way, to get me on Hockey Night again,"" Cole told Hockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean on Saturday night before the beginning of the Toronto Maple Leafs-Chicago Blackhawks game. Watch as Bob Cole discusses the blizzard on Hockey Night in Canada: Others took advantage of the snowdrifts for a little thrill seeking. When he looked at the snow-covered streets of St. John's, free of moving vehicles, Matt Wells saw an opportunity. ""I walked out the front door, strapped on the snowboard and then I proceeded on down Prescott, over Duckworth and on down to Water Street,"" Wells told McCue. ""It was surprising, actually, because there was so much snow, it was actually difficult to get any speed up. It was difficult to go faster or pick up any speed because the snow was so deep,"" he said of his ride. Video of Wells' slide through the streets was shared widely on Facebook on Saturday. Wells is originally from the west coast of New Zealand and attended university in Halifax, but only moved to St. John's a few months ago.  ""It was probably ill-advised for me to go do it myself. But definitely worth it in the end,"" he says of his ride. There were those who wouldn't let the blizzard get in the way of a fun Saturday night. Stumbled across an impromptu Georgetown block party with bonfire in the middle of what should be a street. Beer and comraderie freely shared with all <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLStorm2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NLStorm2020</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QxUlea6rti"">pic.twitter.com/QxUlea6rti</a> And still more have found creative ways to spend this stretch of forced confinement. Some, like Adam Meyer, turned to the ephemeral. Meyer called in CBC's radio special to read something he'd written while watching the blizzard rage: I moved to St. John's just in time for the greatest winter storm in a generation. Now I stand half-buried in a cold Sahara watching streetlights flicker meekly like  tea candles on the verge of being snuffed by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  The house rocks and surges like a wooden ship so that when I close my eyes I see icy cliffs, too close, disappear under the frigid surf thrown around by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  When the power finally fails the world goes not black, but purple, and from the otherworldly shade  it's obvious St. John's is a sibling of Pluto; an icy frontier at the edge of system space, in orbit but  made distinct by the distance and cold as a dwarf-planet by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  The air around the city feels sick as if decades of jet fuel and international trade routes  have concocted a nasty bug to be slowly purged with each retching gust that spews  a break-locking, street-clogging mess culminating in the greatest winter storm in a generation.  I moved to St. John's in time to witness its cold burial but  tomorrow I will wake and find life in the morning after the greatest storm in a generation.  What a load of snow!!

219,Yvette Brend,2020-01-20T21:57:33.568Z,"Some layoffs at MEC but more permanent staff to be hired, CEO says in restructuring plan","Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) is laying off some of its 2,400 employees — but offering permanent positions to many of its casual workers — as it restructures in a bid to restore its financial health. The outdoor retailer, which lost more than $11 million in the past fiscal year, is aiming to cut costs, and change what it stocks and how it staffs, according to an online statement from CEO Phil Arrata. The statement was released after the company's 22 stores across Canada were shut down on Sunday afternoon for a nationwide all-staff meeting, according to employees at several outlets. Store managers read a statement outlining the new direction Arrata plans to take MEC. In some stores that meant a handful of layoffs. MEC declined to confirm a total number. But in his statement, Arrata said the co-op would move away from using casual employees and hire more permanent staff to cut down on staff and sharpen customer service. More than 950 casual staff will be given full- or part-time jobs, with benefits, Arrata said.  ""While MEC is not profit-driven in the same way as the retailers we compete against, we still must be profitable to ensure we deliver great service to our members,"" Arrata said, citing the retailer's co-op model, in an open letter to staff posted online Jan. 20. MEC also plans to sublet its $28-million head office on Great Northern Way in Vancouver. MEC has been struggling and recently went through arbitration after workers at its Vancouver and Victoria stores became the first in its network to unionize. Employees were seeking better wages and working conditions. Arrata, the former chief financial officer at Best Buy Canada, joined MEC in the summer of 2019 and said he was given the mandate to infuse the chain with more profitability. ""I think we could take on the competition. I think we could do better,"" he told CBC in a recent interview. MEC reported an $11.5-million net loss on $462.4 million in sales in 2018/19. The outdoor retailer is facing increasing competition from online giants such as Amazon and Walmart, as well as Canadian Tire, Sport Chek and the French sporting goods chain Decathlon, which has outlets in Quebec and Ontario..",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/restructure-mec-11m-outdoor-gear-mountain-equipment-co-op-staff-layoffs-1.5433645,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mec-union-victoria-vancouver-outdoor-retailer-1.5363693 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mec-11m-outdoor-gear-mountain-equipment-co-op-1.5375846,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/harry-meghan-kitsilano-neighbours-vancouver-1.5432410 /news/canada/british-columbia/four-seasons-closes-joe-segal-1.5428364 /news/canada/british-columbia/winter-storm-terrace-kitimat-1.5433237 /news/canada/british-columbia/swartz-bay-ferry-terminal-protest-1.5433100
220,"Eric Szeto, Katie Pedersen, Asha Tomlinson",2020-01-18T19:18:53.848Z,"Hidden cameras capture misinformation, fundraising tactics used by anti-vaxx movement","They came from across North America, paying $200 each to attend the ritzy event in Washington, D.C., hoping to snag selfies with some of the biggest names in the anti-vaccination movement. For the anti-vaccination activists gathered in the U.S. capital last November, it was also a chance to strategize on ways to further their cause. And they were more than willing to share those strategies with the undercover Marketplace journalists who attended the event, posing as activists trying to grow the movement in Canada. The Marketplace investigation provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the anti-vaxx movement, which experts say is largely to blame for a shift in mindset about vaccination. Nearly half of Canadians today have some concern about vaccine safety. ""Take vaccines out of the name — that way you won't get flagged,"" said one Virginian woman attending the event. She was speaking about how to get around social media filters geared at weeding out anti-vaccination content.  WATCH | A glimpse inside the anti-vaccination movement: The woman also pointed to another popular tactic: Challenging vaccination policies under the seemingly libertarian banner of ""health freedom,"" ""medical freedom,"" or ""informed consent."" Her own group is named Virginians for Informed Consent and has about 1,200 members. She's also gone a step further, making the group almost impossible for the public to find. ""We're secret,"" she said. ""You can't search our name [on Facebook]."" The VIP event attended by Marketplace followed a public rally on Washington's National Mall, where a number of anti-vaccination celebrities — Andrew Wakefield, Del Bigtree and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — galvanized loyal activists, eager to speak out against what they claim is a coverup of a massive vaccine injury epidemic. The movement persists despite a scientific consensus among medical professionals, vaccininologists and toxicologists that vaccines are safe and effective.  ""Their goal is to create noise, to create uncertainty,"" said Timothy Caulfield, a health law and policy expert and author of The Vaccination Picture, a book debunking anti-vaccination myths. ""Spreading misinformation will create chaos — and that's exactly what they've done."" Non-medical exemptions from vaccines have spiked in recent years, as have outbreaks from vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles.  In California, where exemption rates reportedly reached 10 per cent or more in some schools, lawmakers passed new laws limiting such exemptions. Last year, Toronto Public Health passed a motion asking the province to consider removing non-medical exemptions in Ontario. Health officials said exemption rates had more than doubled, to around two per cent, over the past 12 years. But it didn't come without protest: dozens of anti-vaccination activists showed up at city hall to fight that motion.  ""People around the world have stopped vaccinating because of the rhetoric that they've read online, that they've had in discussion groups, about how vaccines may be harmful,"" said Dr. Vinita Dubey, of Toronto Public Health. ""At what point are we going to say: the exemption rates are too high, and we're putting the population at risk?"" In October, Vaccine Choice Canada, an anti-vaccination non-profit group, along with five Ontario mothers, launched a constitutional challenge arguing the province's current vaccination policies — which force parents to go through a course before getting a non-medical exemption or else risk school suspension for their kids — were too onerous and infringed on their rights. The province previously told CBC it would not be considering an end to non-medical exemptions. A few months prior to the constitutional challenge in Ontario, when the government of New Brunswick introduced a bill that would have removed non-medical exemptions, anti-vaxxers gathered in Fredericton to push back against it. At the time, the bill was delayed, though a new bill has since been reintroduced and is currently at second reading. Similar challenges have been launched at statehouses across the United States — most recently in New Jersey, where lawmakers voted down a bill to remove non-medical exemptions. ""They would love to be able to predict what we have going on. They can't predict [it],"" James Lyons-Weiler, a well-known activist who runs a U.S. non-profit anti-vaxx group, said at the Washington event. ""Keep their heads spinning."" Such tactics are ""incredibly craven,"" said Seth Mnookin, author of The Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Autism Controversy.  ""It's a dishonest way to go about things,"" he said. ""I think it shows there's an awareness if they try to have this debate in a real way, and try to present the facts and have honest discussions with parents and with legislators, that their side would lose. ""They don't have facts on their side, and they don't have science."" Marketplace set out to find out just how anti-vaxx groups rally people — and money — for the cause.  Using hidden cameras, social media, court documents and tax returns, Marketplace pieced together a portrait of the movement's misinformation and fundraising tactics. One man who knows a lot about those tactics is Andrew Wakefield, one of the world's most notorious anti-vaxxers, who attended the Washington event. The disgraced British ex-doctor famously helped spawn a generation of vaccine fear after co-authoring a 1998 study linking the MMR vaccine to autism. The study was eventually retracted after it was revealed much of the research was fraudulent and that Wakefield had financial conflicts of interest while doing the work.  Wakefield also lost his medical licence, though he now has a career in the anti-vaccination movement. ""I love Canadians,"" said Wakefield when the undercover Marketplace team introduced themselves. Saying they were hoping to have him speak at a future event in Vancouver, the team asked about Wakefield's speaking fee. Marketplace later learned via email he would charge $3,000 for the engagement. ""I don't begrudge people to earn money to write and give speeches,"" said Mnookin. ""The part I find offensive is that it's money that's made off stoking people's fears and anxieties. I wish he wasn't making money off of falsehoods … he's apparently made a career out of this."" According to tax filings, Wakefield brought in more than $3 million US to advance his debunked cause through non-profits and research over the past decade. A number of those non-profits have since been dissolved. Wakefield's lawyer, Jim Moody, confirmed his client has raised ""a few million"" dollars for the cause but said he is not a ""profiteer on this issue."" Moody said the money was originally put toward research projects, but Wakefield has since pivoted, and ""most of his output now is in advocacy, film, written work and speeches, and not in published research papers."" ""If he does know that it is a lie, this is a pretty evil pursuit,"" said Caulfield of Wakefield's ongoing anti-vaxx advocacy.   ""If he doesn't know it's a lie, that he's somehow tricked himself into believing his nonsense, it shows an incredible ability to ignore the truth … it shows an incredible ability to allow harm to continue despite what the science says."" Another leader of the movement is Del Bigtree, a former TV producer and controversial filmmaker who travels the world to host various speaking engagements and founded a non-profit called the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN). He's also one of Wakefield's biggest defenders, working on a controversial documentary with him in 2016, and is often at the forefront of rallies protesting legislation that would limit vaccine exemptions. Bigtree grabbed headlines last year when The Washington Post and others reported that the Selz Foundation — run by a wealthy New York hedge fund founder and his wife — gave ICAN more than $1 million US to further the anti-vaxx cause. According to 2017 tax filings for the non-profit, that accounted for a majority of the $1.4 million the group raised that year. Watch as Marketplace host Asha Tomlinson questions Del Bigtree about vaccine research: When asked about Bigtree's speaking fees, his manager, James Sherrer, told an undercover Marketplace journalist he, too, charged $3,000, not including airfare and hotel. ""It's worth it these days,"" he said. ""He's pretty in demand."" Bigtree later told Marketplace that speaking fees ""help to fund the greater part of my work, which involves travelling state to state to speak and educate for free."" Other anti-vaxx figures, such as James Lyons-Weiler, find workarounds. Since 2015, Lyons-Weiler, has run a self-described ""progressive science"" group. He told Marketplace's undercover journalists that he's ""not for or against"" vaccines.  ""I'm a not-for-profit — I'm just educating,"" he said at the VIP event. Yet in speeches, he touts the false claim that ""vaccines can and do cause autism"" and holds events at which he vows to ""bring the science."" Earlier this month, he held an event in Los Angeles with another high-profile activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where they charged $40 to $55 US per ticket. When asked how much it would cost to bring him to Canada to speak, Lyons-Weiler told the undercover Marketplace team that he didn't charge, because it would make him ""an international lobbyist."" ""So, what I would rather do is, I do a science day the day before,"" he said. ""I'd run an event where you ... charge admission as per my website."" ""Sounds like a promo thing for you, a marketing thing for you,"" said our journalist. ""Now we've gotta quid pro quo.""  ""That's right,"" he said, later detailing through an assistant that for a group of 400 people, he would want about $20 US per person, netting around $10,000 Cdn. ""I think that there is a large majority of them ... [that] must be aware of the science. And this is a way of creating celebrity, this is a way of creating demand, this is a way of making a living,"" said Caulfield.  Lyons-Weiler later told Marketplace in an email that there is nothing wrong with getting paid for his services and that there are costs associated with holding events. One activist at the Washington event recommended that Marketplace's undercover team use AmazonSmile to fundraise, the charity arm through which the online retailer donates 0.5 per cent of eligible Amazon purchases to whichever registered charity a customer selects. ""It's almost kind of like, 'Ha ha, Amazon,'"" said the participant, referring to Amazon's attempts to remove anti-vaccination books and videos from its site. ""They're trying to restrict … free speech, but you're still donating to my vaccine charity."" As part of its investigation, Marketplace found a number of anti-vaxx non-profits on AmazonSmile to which customers could donate. When asked about them, Amazon said organizations that support ""intolerance, hate, terrorism, violence, money laundering, or other illegal activities are not eligible."" It said that if there are violations of this agreement, an organization's ""eligibility will be revoked.""  While online platforms, and social media, in particular, have become a primary tool in the anti-vaccination fight, companies — such as Facebook — have begun hiding (but not removing) such content from search results, in part because of pressure from lawmakers. Still, Marketplace found dozens of groups in Canada and the U.S. that purport to advocate for ""health freedom"" and ""informed consent"" but regularly promoted content questioning vaccine safety. Most of the groups, such as the ""Oklahomans for Health and Parental Rights"" or ""Informed Choice Washington,"" were at the top of Facebook's search feeds. Those two groups combined had more than 25,000 followers. Groups such as Vaccine Choice Canada — a major Canadian anti-vaccination group — were also in the feed. And anti-vaccination leaders, such as Wakefield, Kennedy Jr. and Bigtree, were also searchable. Facebook has also been home to paid anti-vaccination advertising. Several media outlets have reported most of the ads had been purchased by two organizations, including Kennedy Jr.'s non-profit, World Mercury Project, which later became the Children's Health Defense. Though those ads have since been banned, the reach of that misinformation was widespread. Based on Marketplace's analysis, dozens of vaccine-related ads from Kennedy Jr.'s group had one to three million impressions on Facebook over a two-year period. Kennedy Jr. did not respond to Marketplace's request for comment. Marketplace shared the findings of the investigation with Facebook, including a number of pages that spread misinformation.  In response, Facebook told Marketplace it had flagged and reduced distribution for three of the pages for ""spreading vaccine misinformation."" The company also said it disabled a number of other accounts, because they violate Facebook's policies on misrepresentation.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-vaccination-information-wars-social-media-1.5037006 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-canada-homeopathy-vaccine-hesitancy-1.5058393,/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845 /news/health/canada-us-measles-elimination-status-1.5300111 /news/health/measles-vaccination-information-wars-social-media-1.5037006 /news/health/pinterest-world-health-organization-vaccine-social-media-1.5263536

Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball said an emergency operations centre will open to centralize requests for help from residents. Soldiers will be available for residents who need assistance with snow clearing and other support.  He said a ""high volume of calls"" is expected. ""We just want to help people now clean up and clear out ... so emergency workers can get to them,"" Ball told CBC's radio special on the storm Sunday afternoon. Watch: For some, all that snow means fun Newfoundlanders are facing a full day of shovelling after Friday's record-setting blizzard, and there is more nasty weather to come. St. John's set a new one-day snowfall record on Friday of 76.2 cm, beating the previous record of 68.4 cm set back on April 5, 1999, according to Environment Canada. Meanwhile, 93 cm fell in Mount Pearl and 91 cm fell in Paradise.  Earlier Sunday the federal weather agency issued weather warnings and statements for much of the island, except for the west coast and northern peninsula. Central Newfoundland is under snowfall warnings and there are winter storm warnings on the south coast. Upwards of 20 to 25 cm of snow is possible, according to CBC Newfoundland meteorologist Ashley Brauweiler. For eastern Newfoundland, 10 to 15 cm is likely, with some areas seeing upwards of 20 cm. In the early morning hours Monday, that should change to drizzle for the metro area, but southern areas on the Avalon will see between 5 and 15 mm of rain, she said.  Winds could whip up to between 80 and 90 km/h overnight in eastern Newfoundland.  ""It's unbelievable when you think about it,"" Ball said of the coming second wave of snow. Municipalities throughout the area have declared states of emergency, which restrict residents' movements to allow snow-clearing operations to carry on unimpeded. Residents who are running low on supplies will have few options in St. John's, where a state of emergency will remain in effect on Monday. The city said pharmacies are not permitted to open Monday, revising its statement from earlier on Sunday regarding the state of emergency ""given the current weather conditions and the addition anticipated snowfall [Sunday] evening."" Snow-clearing contractors are permitted to carry out their work, and gas stations may open to provide emergency fuel needed for snow removal, the city said in a statement. Garbage and recycling collection will not proceed Monday, the city said.  A spokesperson for the city of St. John's said the city expects businesses to honour the state of emergency amid reports some businesses not covered under the exceptions have been opening.  She said the city can charge anyone in violation of the state of emergency order, with a penalty of up to $5,000 if convicted. Even with the easing of some restrictions, the city is still advising people to ""stay in and off city streets."" John Haggie, the province's health minister, advised residents needing prescriptions to call their local pharmacy to make sure it's open and that a refill is available. He noted, however, that any pharmacy in the province is able to dispense a prescription no matter which pharmacy it was first brought to.  Haggie also advised residents who may be concerned they are having a medical issue to call the 811 health line to get advice before calling 911 or trying to venture to a hospital.  ""The roads are not entirely safe,"" he cautioned. The Town of Paradise, 20 kilometres west of St. John's, announced Sunday that it will temporarily lift its state of emergency between 6 a.m. and midnight daily, effective Monday. Starting Monday, ""and until further notice,"" all businesses must close by midnight daily and no vehicles are allowed on roads between midnight and 6 a.m. to allow for snow-clearing operations, a statement from the town said. Only town snow-clearing equipment, emergency vehicles, essential workers getting to work and private snow-clearing contractors are allowed to be on the roads overnight. ""We ask all residents to stay home unless absolutely necessary,"" the statement goes on. The town of Conception Bay South, 36 kilometres west of St. John's, lifted its state of emergency at 4 p.m. Watch as neighbours in CBS stay connected through a snow maze Pharmacies in the town will be able to open immediately. A warming centre is also open at the Salvation Army church until 9 p.m. Residents were allowed to travel to pharmacies and to the warming centre before 4 p.m. The Town of Torbay also plans to lift its state of emergency between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. effective Monday. Before then, several exceptions are in place, including allowing private snow-clearing operations, the delivery of oil to homes and the movement of essential workers, among other accommodations.  Town buildings and facilities will remain closed Monday. Meanwhile, in Portugal Cove-St. Philips, a state of emergency will go back into effect at 9 p.m. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said while crews have had a lot of success and worked through the night, there's still a lot to be done.   ""There's a tremendous amount of snow on the ground,"" he told CBC News Network on Sunday morning. Watch: Snow piles up in N.L.'s record storm Breen said a series of storms has had snowplow operators working steadily since Christmas Eve and said they are getting help from Corner Brook as well as from other levels of government. Most major thoroughfares have been widened, he said, with many streets at least having ""one cut"" through them.  But the goal remains clearing roads for emergency vehicles and allowing private snow-removal contractors to service their clients so businesses can eventually reopen. ""Right now, the streets, we don't feel that they're in a condition that's suitable enough to open up the city tomorrow,"" he told the CBC radio special on Sunday afternoon. Asked about criticism that the city seemed under-prepared for the massive storm, Breen said there are three things to note: the high volume of snow, the rate at which the snow fell and the high winds, which at times reached up to 150 km/h. ""So this was a storm that would have been challenging for any operation,"" he said. The province announced that all government offices in the St. John's metro area will be closed Monday. The province's English school district has announced that all schools on the Avalon Peninsula will be closed Monday as well. Several schools on the Bonavista Peninsula will also be closed. Watch: Retired sports host reports on N.L. weather emergency Meanwhile, Memorial University has announced that its St. John's, Marine Institute and Signal Hill campuses will remain closed on Monday ""to facilitate cleanup from Friday's blizzard."" The closure includes all evening classes and activities, and the child-care centre.  The closure means access to university buildings is restricted, according to a statement from the university. ""Please do not come to campus,"" the statement said. Noreen Golfman, the university's vice president academic, has encouraged all instructors to be flexible with course work. ""This includes, but is not limited to, deadlines for submission of assignments, papers, etc., as well as attendance in classes and laboratories over the next couple of days,"" said a statement from the university. College of the North Atlantic's Ridge Road campus will also be closed Monday. Around 11:30 a.m., Newfoundland Power was reporting 2,499 customers without electricity. The utility later reported new power outages, mostly in Pleasantville to east end St. John's, Topsail, Kelligrews and Upper Gullies areas. On Saturday, Newfoundland Power reported it had reconnected about 75 per cent of customers impacted by the storm. The federal government has approved the province's request for assistance with the cleanup, including army mobilization. In a tweet, St. John's Airport said its airfield is only available for air ambulance and military aircraft and that commercial flights will not start up until at least Monday at 8 p.m. Update 3: Commercial flight ops will not resume until at least 8pm Monday, Jan. 20th.

223,Anonymous,2020-01-19T12:00:00.685Z,Fitness class for people with early-onset dementia a place for body and mind,"It may look like an ordinary fitness class, but there's something unique about this weekly gathering at Carleton University's athletics centre — every participant has been diagnosed with early-onset dementia. Its members, who range in age from 48 to 65, have been meeting here every Tuesday since last October to run, swim and do Pilates together. Robin Meyers, director of community support services for charity Carefor, came up with the idea. Because fitness programs for Alzheimer's patients are normally geared toward participants 65 and over, younger clients felt like they didn't fit in, she said. ""The age is different, the music we listen to, the activities — it's chair exercises versus sort of a physical activity. I mean, I can't integrate Pilates into most of my seniors' groups, but this group can do it,"" Meyers told CBC's Ottawa Morning. But it's not just the physical activities that make this group different, she said. Part fitness class, part social club, it's also a comfortable place for members to talk through some of the unique challenges facing people diagnosed with dementia at an early age. ""Someone under the age of 65 is likely very in tune with the fact they're living with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's and probably willing to talk about it. That would be very different from someone who's, say, 80 years old,"" Meyers said. The group has no official name, but some of the sly ideas members have suggested — The Brainy Bunch and Stay Fit and Forget About It — certainly suggest an upbeat attitude. ""I think the most important thing for people to keep in mind is that [early-onset dementia is] not necessarily a death sentence, in and of itself,"" participant Tom Makichuk told Ottawa Morning. ""It's a new chapter. It's a new opportunity. It's a chance to explore something and live something different."" The group's youngest member, Sylvain Lepage, 48, was diagnosed in October. Lepage said before joining, he didn't do much. ""My wife says I used to live in 'Youtubeland.' I used to have my tablet and my earphones and watched Youtube all day long,"" he told Ottawa Morning. ""We know we come here because we have dementia, but we forget about it for the day."" Membership is currently capped at 10, and there's a wait list. Meyers, whose own husband was diagnosed with the disease three years ago, said she's hoping that popularity will signal the need for similar programs elsewhere.  ""This is exactly what I had hoped for,"" she said, choking back tears. ""Bringing people together and seeing that they're just like everyone else.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/early-onset-dementia-fitness-club-1.5430529,[],[]
224,Anonymous,2020-01-20T21:06:05.947Z,Lawyer argues detective hired by Sandeson's defence team was a 'traitor',"A lawyer for convicted killer William Sandeson has argued that a detective hired by the defence before the murder trial but who later talked to police was a ""traitor"" and that the judge did not address the issue fairly. Dalhousie student Taylor Samson, 22, was killed in August 2015 in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. He is appealing that conviction. A hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway Monday morning in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer Ian Smith asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes liveblogged from court: He focused much of his arguments on the issue of retired RCMP Sgt. Bruce Webb, who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment.  Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until in the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe.  The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Josh Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of the detective's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. He said Arnold failed to ask himself whether Canadians would be shocked to learn a member of the defence became a ""state agent"" in the midst of an investigation. ""The defence had a traitor of the defence team... [Sandeson] was betrayed by someone with a duty to him,"" Smith told the three-member Appeal Court panel. ""It was incumbent on the trial judge to consider all the factors."" Had police sought legal advice, Smith said they likely would have been told not to accept Webb's information. He argued it was a violation of the police's oath of office. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb.  She pointed out that the name ""Bruce"" was referred to throughout the statements from the two witnesses ⁠— which were in the hands of the defence before the trial ⁠— and that it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone that he was involved. ""We see the connection that should have made this absolutely apparent to [Sandeson's lawyer],"" she said. ""It's all over this that he was involved. ""You know what the easiest thing to do is here, you call up and the Crown and say, 'Who's Bruce?'"" She said the trial judge was in the best position to determine if there was a miscarriage and whether a mistrial was warranted. But Justice David Farrar, a member of the Appeal Court panel, suggested Monday police had an obligation to defence to tell them what Webb had done. ""How can our system ever survive if we allow police to subvert the interest of justice?"" he said. MacLellan noted Arnold found that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. She agreed with those findings. She also said Webb feared he could be charged with obstruction of justice if he failed to reveal to investigators that two Crown witnesses had lied in their earlier police statements. Smith said another ground for appeal is that investigators conducted the search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant, claiming there were ""exigent circumstances"" which justified their actions. Police said that at the time of the search, they were worried Samson was being held hostage as part of a drug deal gone bad. But Smith argued there was no evidence Samson had been in the apartment and that the search was not lawful. ""They had only a hunch that Samson was present,"" he said. ""The search of the home is a serious invasion of privacy."" Smith said after the initial search, police returned to the apartment to turn off a DVR Sandeson had been using as part of a surveillance system, fearing its contents could be erased remotely. Smith argued there was no evidence to suggest that could happen, and there was no reasonable basis for returning to the apartment a second time. Smith claimed Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officer's aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. He noted Sandeson is repeatedly referred to as a ""monster."" Sandeson said very little during the interrogations and asked for a lawyer, he said. Smith also argued the finding of first-degree murder was unreasonable. He said the Crown's theory that he planned the killing is possible, but so are the theories that he was simply planning a drug deal or a robbery. ""There's also strong evidence that there was no plan,"" said Smith, noting Sandeson identified his apartment in text messages and had items in his apartment that would identify him. Two days have been set aside for the appeal hearing. MacLellan is expected to continuing making arguments on Tuesday. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-nova-scotia-halifax-1.5428347,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-appeal-hearing-taylor-samson-1.5163626 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/former-mayor-queens-northern-pulp-1.5431434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/children-in-care-policy-review-community-services-1.5432535 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/newfoundland-little-bay-islands-feral-cats-nova-scotia-rescued-barn-1.5432139 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/late-fee-renew-licence-frustrates-n-s-doctor-1.5431493,[]
225,Anonymous,2020-01-16T17:17:24.939Z,Canada calls for an independent criminal investigation into Flight PS752 crash,"Canada and its international partners are pushing for an independent criminal investigation into the destruction of the Ukrainian passenger flight in Iran last week that killed all 176 people aboard, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said this morning. The minister was in London, U.K. today to chair the first meeting of an international co-ordination and response group made up of representatives of nations that lost citizens in the crash: Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom. After a day of closed-door meetings, ministers from the five nations emerged with a framework for co-operation with Iran. Watch: Champagne says the world is watching Iran Among other things, the framework calls for an ""independent criminal investigation, followed by transparent and impartial judicial proceedings,"" said Champagne. ""The world is watching,"" he added. ""There's a path for Iran to continue in the first step they've done, which is to admit full responsibility. And when you admit full responsibility, there are consequences that flow from them and full cooperation is part of that."" The international group's other demands include: The gathering at Canada House on London's Trafalgar Square began with a small ceremony of remembrance, with the five ministers each lighting a separate wick on a single candle and pausing for a moment of silence. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok attended the meeting to brief the ministers on lessons learned during his country's five-year probe of the crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. Investigators concluded the aircraft was shot down by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Under international law, Iran is leading the aviation investigation because the crash occurred within its borders, but there are precedents for handing that responsibility over to another country that suffered losses. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau said Iran is co-operating with the two Canadian Transportation Safety Board investigators on the scene, but Canada still wants official status in Iran's investigation — which would allow Canadian officials to take part in the analysis of the flight recorders' data. ""We are judging Iran every day, demand by demand. Yes, we have good first steps from Iran. But obviously, this is a long process,"" said Champagne. ""So our vision, our assessment is based on the state of facts today. We have proposed a number of things to the Iranian government."" Besides pushing Iran to compensate the victims' families, the prime minister's parliamentary secretary, Omar Alghabra, said the government also is considering offering family members of the victims a form of interim compensation while they wait for settlement of their compensation claims against Iran. ""We are actively exploring these options and we hope a decision will be made in short order,"" Alghabra said.  Watch: Champagne outlines demands from grieving nations",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-london-meeting-1.5428925,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/carleton-university-mourns-plane-crash-victims-1.5428623 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649,/news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649 /news/canada/ottawa/carleton-university-mourns-plane-crash-victims-1.5428623 /news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-universities-moment-silence-1.5427629 /news/technology/iran-fact-checking-site-factnameh-1.5426502
226,Frances Willick,2020-01-17T10:00:00.809Z,When donors cross the line: Charitable sector grapples with sexual harassment ,"As Carly Butler got ready to attend another big gala for her job as a major gifts fundraiser, she put on a special dress she'd often wear on such occasions. But for this particular event at a high-end Nova Scotia resort, she took an extra precaution, placing a safety pin at the neckline to be prudent. She'd heard there had been ""bad behaviour"" at the event in the past. As she and her co-workers arrived at the resort, one charity staffer joked to the crew, ""OK, ladies, lock up your vaginas!"" Soon after, Butler had an experience she would later describe as ""a general disrespect"" of her professionalism. Her job as a fundraiser for the IWK Foundation — the charitable organization that supports the women and children's hospital in Halifax — required her to drum up $1.5 million in donations the year she was employed there. During the event, a potential donor asked her to meet him outside in 10 minutes so they could drive his luxury car down a nearby private runway, even though he was drunk. When she said no, he told her she could drive — that there were no police around, and what happened at the resort would stay at the resort. She didn't get in the car that day nearly five years ago. But she worries that younger or more vulnerable women starting out their fundraising career may have. As the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across industry after industry, some in the fundraising sector say it's time for their profession to step up efforts to tackle and prevent sexual harassment. Workers in some fundraising roles can be particularly vulnerable to harassment due to the deep power imbalance between fundraisers — who are often young women, and whose jobs depend on meeting donation targets — and donors, who are often wealthy older men. And events like golf tournaments, galas or auction evenings — especially where alcohol is involved — are ripe for abuse of that inequality, say industry insiders. CBC News spoke with nearly a dozen women across the country who work in the non-profit sector. Nearly all had experiences of being harassed by donors or other employees, either with unwanted touching, sexual innuendo or inappropriate propositions. One spoke of a former premier grabbing her butt at an event, another of an older donor putting his hand on her knee and offering to ""treat"" her to a night at the iconic Ottawa hotel Chateau Laurier, while another woman told of a men's group of potential donors leaving a photo of a naked woman on the podium where she was about to speak. Jacquie Stoyek, who worked in marketing at the IWK Foundation for about five years until leaving in 2017, attended the same fundraiser as Butler. She recalled seeing a businessman — already intoxicated first thing in the morning — making comments about a foundation staff member and pretending behind her back to grab her butt. Stoyek said a senior foundation staff member saw that and gave her a look that said, ""Watch out for this one,"" and it became an ongoing joke. The IWK Foundation declined to answer any questions about the fundraising event, saying in a two-sentence statement it is ""unable to provide comment on the specific circumstances"" of Butler and Stoyek's allegations. But at the time — after Butler reported the luxury car incident to her peers and superiors — she was told not to go to future meetings with that donor by herself. Butler said the man cancelled a followup meeting with her when he learned she would not be alone. The IWK Foundation said in a statement: ""With respect to the issue of harassment, it is a very important topic in every sector and we continue to work within our organization to foster a culture of openness, respect and safety."" The foundation would not comment on whether the event is still taking place. A survey on sexual harassment conducted in 2018 by the Harris Poll for the Association of Fundraising Professionals and the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that a quarter of female respondents and seven per cent of male respondents had experienced sexual harassment in the field. The survey involved about 1,000 fundraisers, including about 900 people living in the U.S. and 100 living in Canada. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, a donor was the perpetrator. But less than half of those who were harassed told their organization about the incident. Beth Ann Locke, who until recently served as the chief philanthropy officer for the B.C. Women's Health Foundation, said women are worried about the questions that will be asked — ""What did you do to make him do that? Did you flirt with him?"" They are also concerned that reporting the incident will hurt their career, say many in the industry. If they no longer work with a major donor who has harassed them, they may not get invited to events, be asked to take on large accounts or meet their donation targets for the year. At small organizations, there often isn't another staffer who can take over an account involving a harasser. Fundraisers are also passionate about the organizations and causes they work for, and are reluctant to do anything that could harm them, say several of the women interviewed by the CBC. Locke is one of the co-founders of Ms. Rupt, a group that aims to spark conversation and action on challenges facing female fundraisers. ""What drives me crazy is that all of us as fundraisers work to help people who have no voice — so whether that's the Amazon rainforest or, you know, dogs in Halifax or people with dementia, right? ""And yet we don't stand up for ourselves and we kind of allow this to happen in our own profession."" Locke said she has experienced several incidents of harassment over the course of her career, including someone asking her to be their ""mistress,"" someone stroking her arm and commenting on her skin and an uninvited hand on her knee under the table. She said the most severe instance of harassment occurred years ago while she was working in the U.S., when a superior grabbed her wrist — which she promptly wrenched away — and then held his erect penis through his clothes, saying, ""This is what you do to me."" Locke said she reported the incident to human resources, which forced the man to take three days off without pay and lectured both parties about ""this kind of stuff going on in our office.""  ""It was like a dressing-down you'd get from your parents,"" Locke said. That type of lacklustre response does not appear to be unusual, according to the Harris Poll survey. Of the respondents who had experienced sexual harassment and told their organization about it, 71 per cent said no action had been taken against the perpetrator. Thirty-five per cent of respondents who took steps to deal with the harassment said they experienced a negative impact on their career after reporting it. Locke said organizations within the non-profit sector need to take allegations more seriously. She said she's heard stories of organizations giving donors or other perpetrators a ""pass"" for harassing behaviour: ""'He's sweet.' 'Oh, don't worry about it.' Even kind of a 'he doesn't know what he's doing' thing.… Or 'they're from a different age when that was allowed.' I've heard that one."" Some smaller non-profits that run on a shoestring budget don't have a separate human resources department to deal with complaints.  Lucy White, a Toronto consultant for the non-profit sector, said one of the barriers to change in the industry is that when people do file complaints about harassment, the cases are often settled out of court and out of the public eye, often with non-disclosure agreements that forbid them from discussing details. ""So the real problem is no one ever admits publicly that they did anything wrong and we never find out any of the facts,"" White said. ""We're left in the dark about how often this kind of thing happens."" That silence also means other organizations and those who sit on their board of directors never learn what kind of financial repercussions can stem from findings of harrassment, and the liabilities their own charities could face if allegations emerge. ""What happens is they think it's not a big deal, right?"" White said. There is some movement afoot to help prevent sexual harassment in the fundraising sector. The Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), an organization that has 3,500 members across Canada and over 30,000 internationally, has formed the Women's Impact Initiative to address challenges facing women in the sector. The AFP, which helped commission the Harris Poll survey, is following up on the results by interviewing fundraisers about their experiences of job-related harassment. The association already has a donor bill of rights that outlines what donors are entitled to as a result of their donations, but it is now considering developing a similar document outlining a donor's responsibilities when working with fundraisers. Some in the profession say non-profits should take other concrete steps, including implementing and enforcing clear anti-harassment policies, overtly encouraging employees and bystanders to come forward with complaints and improving diversity on boards of directors. But money is often the bottom line for charitable and non-profit organizations. Perhaps accepting donations from harassers is where the buck must stop, said Caroline Riseboro, the president of AFP Toronto, the largest chapter in the world. ""If targets are missed, boards tend to get nervous. But, you know, boards need to understand if targets are missed because of a harassment issue, then that's OK. Better to keep employees safe than to meet the target or the goal."" Riseboro said she believes most boards do take action when they know about instances of harassment, but board members often don't realize the behaviour is going on. For some in the fundraising sector, any impending cultural change has come too late.  Butler, the fundraiser who worked for the IWK Foundation, left the profession, saying despite the enjoyable aspects of the job, ""there's a whole bunch of distasteful things about it"" — including, sometimes, the dynamic between the people who work in fundraising and donors. ""It doesn't feel great after a while.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-violence-harassment-fundraising-1.4945951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cobequid-toll-highway-highway-104-public-private-partnership-1.5426142 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbu-prof-plans-to-commercialize-waste-water-cleaning-technology-1.5429702 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/man-found-not-criminally-responsible-for-killing-wife-gets-her-life-insurance-1.5429351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/woodpecker-phone-line-cable-internet-servic-1.5430134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cermaq-st-marys-bay-public-meeting-fish-farm-salmon-company-council-1.5429551,[]

228,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-07-08T18:29:27.210Z,"Mother who watched son burn to death in SUV fire joins calls for answers from Kia, Hyundai ","When Carol Nash heard screams for help, she rushed out of her apartment in her nightgown and found her SUV burning in the parking lot — but couldn't get close enough to save her son, sitting in the driver's seat. ""I could not do anything except stand there and watch him die,"" Nash told Go Public. Keith Nash, 48, burned to death on April 19, 2017, in his mother's 2014 Kia Soul while the vehicle was parked outside her low-rise apartment building in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother says Kia has never contacted her to explain what happened. She was devastated when she learned the company issued a recall for the SUV for a potential fire risk in February — two years after her son died. ""I suffer on a daily basis with this because I have no answers,"" she said.  Since 2015, Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia have recalled more than three million vehicles in North America over concerns the engines could fail at high speeds or burst into flames. A Go Public investigation revealed other models weren't on any Canadian recall lists when drivers experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires. After the CBC News investigation, both Kia and Hyundai vastly expanded the number of recalls in Canada. Hyundai is a part-owner of Kia. Automobile safety advocates and vehicle owners accuse the two companies of downplaying fire and engine failure reports and taking too long to roll out recalls, raising questions about when they first knew of the safety issues and whether more vehicles might still pose a risk. ""We now have multiple years of reports of these catastrophic engine failures and the very slow reaction from the companies,"" said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. The automakers say they are on top of the problems and are working with Transport Canada to address them. The official cause of death for Keith Nash was smoke and gas inhalation. Fire investigators believe the blaze started in the engine area, but weren't able to determine the exact cause.  In an email to Go Public, Kia suggests that fentanyl and heroin found in Nash's system may have rendered him unconscious and unable to get out of the burning car. The auto giant also says Nash may have caused the fire by simultaneously pressing down on the accelerator and brake pedals while the vehicle was in ""drive"" mode, causing the transmission fluid to ignite — an issue unrelated to the recall issued two years later, the company says. Go Public put that to Hamilton mechanic Chris Solodko, who has repaired dozens of Kia and Hyundai vehicles following engine failures. He says it's very rare for transmission fluid to catch fire. According to Solodko, Nash would have had to apply an enormous amount of pressure to the brake while holding the accelerator down to keep the SUV from moving and causing the transmission fluid to heat up to the point of catching fire. Carol Nash isn't the only one who wants answers.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they've experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires with vehicles that aren't part of any recall.  Robert Mitchell recalled getting a panicked phone call from his 30-year-old son Ryan on Aug. 11. Ryan told him he was driving the family's 2016 Hyundai Elantra down one of the busiest highways in the Toronto area — the 403 — when the engine seized and started to smoke before bursting into flames.  ""I don't think that a car — any car — should blow up and burn like that,"" Robert Mitchell said from the family's home in Mississauga, Ont. Mitchell's insurance company paid for the destroyed car. According to Transport Canada, the fire started in the engine compartment, but the cause is unknown. Another Hyundai Elantra, a 2018 model, is at the centre of a fire investigation in Windsor, N.S. On March 27, an Elantra that had been parked in front of a duplex for hours burst into flames. The fire spread to the building, but the families inside escaped unhurt.

Transport Canada says the investigation is now in the hands of a private insurance company. Kia and Hyundai are now facing a flood of lawsuits in the U.S. and at least two in Canada over the engine breakdowns and fires. The recalls issued so far cover certain Hyundai and Kia models produced after 2011, mostly involving a variety of safety concerns around what are called Theta-II engines. In some cases, the recalls address mechanical issues that could lead to engine failure. In others, software is installed that gives drivers advance warning of an engine problem.  Levine says his organization is seeing other types of engines breaking down or burning. He points out, for example, that Nash's Kia Soul — which was recalled in February — and the Hyundai Elantra don't have Theta engines. ""It's certainly troubling that it's going on at least several years ... these non-crash fires across a variety of makes and models, not only the Theta-II,"" he said. Go Public asked both Kia Canada and Hyundai Canada when they first knew about the engine defects, but neither company answered the question. Hyundai Canada was asked if it had a fix for the engine problems, but again, it didn't respond to the question directly. In an email, Hyundai Canada told Go Public that over the past 10 years, there have been 12 cases of engine fires determined to be a result of an issue with the vehicle itself. ""We stand behind the quality of our products and continuously work to ensure the highest safety standards for our customers,"" spokesperson Bianca Pettinaro wrote. She says the company has issued notices for all the vehicles that could be affected and is keeping an eye on the issues.   In another email, Kia Canada spokesperson Mark James wrote, ""A vehicle engine failure or fire can occur due to any number of complex factors, including inadequate maintenance, arson, or some other non-vehicle source, all cases must be carefully evaluated by trained technicians to determine its cause."" He says Kia has a strong safety record and promptly reports safety-related defects to Transport Canada. Hyundai and Kia are now being investigated by regulators in several countries — including Canada and the U.S. — over safety defects that may have led to engine failures and fires not caused by crashes.  Nearly 540,000 Hyundai and Kia vehicles are now under recall in Canada due to risk of engine failure or fire. Transport Canada is investigating whether more models should be part of the recalls after getting approximately 200 complaints about engines since 2014. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. is investigating engine failures and fires in certain model years. As of the end of March, the regulator had received more than 3,000 complaints of fires not related to collisions, including 103 injuries and one death. Those are the kind of answers Carol Nash is looking for — and that need to come from the automakers involved, she says.  ""I just don't want this ever for any other parent or any other mother to go through what I went through on that day."" Last November, both Kia and Hyundai refused to testify at a congressional hearing that was scheduled to look into the engine fires. That hearing was cancelled after the automakers declined to attend.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

229,Jesse Johnston,2020-01-16T17:22:49.589Z,"He didn't pay his phone bill for 5 years. No one noticed. Now he owes Telus $5,000","A B.C. man who unknowingly went five years without paying his phone bill has been told he owes Telus more than $5,000. Steve Wright, a music teacher from Sechelt, a community about 65 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, says he was stunned when the phone company notified him of the snafu last August. ""I had no reason to think anything was wrong,"" Wright said. ""Someone had been paying my bills without either of our knowledge."" He's now in a dispute over how this happened and who is responsible. Telus says the problem came to light when a former customer contacted them in August, about withdrawals from their bank account which had continued for two years.  The company says it investigated and, according to a statement, ""learned this other individual's account had in fact been paying Mr. Wright's bills for five years, totalling $11,384.60.""  The former customer was reimbursed, Telus says, and Wright was told he would have to pay his last two years' worth of bills, which add up to $5,466.36. Telus has given him 30 months to pay.  But Wright says he believes the mistake was made by Telus, and, even if he did make an error, the company should have caught it. ""I think they need to get their system straight,"" he said. ""When someone enters their banking information and it spits out someone else's information, if it's human error, then find out."" He wants an apology for what he says were excessive emails and calls from Telus over the mix up. He claims he was treated like he did something wrong and that he's had to take time off work to solve the problem. ""The reason I dug my heels in was the way I was treated, right out of the gate,"" he said. Telus says all correspondence with Wright was ""professional and friendly."" Wright's offer to pay off his debt over five years to keep his bill payments manageable was declined by Telus.  ""I would like five years to pay this off,"" Wright said. Cases like this are extremely rare, according to John Lawford, executive director of the Canada Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a consumer protection group.  ""The reason for the mix up is usually a transcription error at the end which is the service provider,"" he said. ""Someone types in the wrong number or links two accounts in their system improperly. They should really have a system to double check the information."" As for how he went five years without noticing his unpaid bills, Wright says he never had a problem with his account, so he assumed everything was fine. ""I'll ask you the same question,"" he said. ""The individual who was paying my bills for five years, how did he not notice?"" Read the full statement from Telus.

230,Anonymous,2020-01-20T17:48:53.470Z,Quebec wants to transfer non-urgent 911 calls to Info-Santé,"It's not unheard of for people to call 911 when they break an ankle or have a bad backache — and while sometimes a trip to the hospital by ambulance is warranted, that isn't always the case. To help ease the load on ambulance technicians, the province has been testing transferring non-urgent calls to 811 instead. It's a second triage, of sorts: if the call meets certain criteria, it's transferred to a nurse, who takes over and conducts a more in-depth evaluation on the patient then decides whether an ambulance is necessary. The main job of an ambulance technician is to save lives, says Dr. Élyse Berger Pelleter, who works for the Health Ministry. But with an aging population and a shortage of ambulance technicians in the province, the situation on the ground is far from ideal — putting a lot of pressure on emergency medical services. ""The objective is that ambulance workers respond to cardiac arrest, heart attacks — people who really need their skills,"" Berger Pelleter said. The Health Ministry wants to have the new system fully established provincewide by 2022. Berger Pelletier said she hopes eventually, people who call with non-urgent problems will get a doctor's appointment, if need be. ""The client is satisfied. It's efficient. Everyone is happy. That's where we're headed."" The pilot project is in its third year in four regions: Montreal, Laval, Chaudière-Appalaches and the Eastern Townships. The transferred calls are being handled by a dedicated team of Info-Santé nurses in Laval. The chief of service, Nancy Vachon, says the team is able to handle about 3,000 calls a month. In Montreal and Laval, 23,000 non-urgent calls were transferred to 811 between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. In 20 per cent of those cases — about 4,800 calls in all — the Info-Santé nurse determined there was no need for an ambulance. Officials expect the results to be less impressive in the two more rural regions, because residents living where there is less access to taxis or public transport are more likely to have an ambulance sent to them, Berger Pelletier said. Urgences-Santé, the emergency medical service that covers Montreal and Laval, gets up to 1,300 calls per day, said the agency's director, Vincent Brouillard. He said the pilot project is allowing the agency to respond to real emergencies, relieving the pressure on paramedics in general. It is having another effect, as well, he said: fewer ambulance transports mean there are fewer people in emergency rooms, so it is also easing overcrowding. Those experiencing non-urgent health issues can call 811 directly instead of 911. For non-urgent situations involving Montreal police, the general number is 514-280-2222, or you can call your local station directly.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/911-811-quebec-emergency-non-urgent-calls-1.5432985,[],/news/canada/montreal/winter-clinics-open-early-1.5380121 /news/canada/montreal/emergency-room-overcrowding-1.5416577 /news/canada/montreal/flu-shot-awareness-campaign-1.5314207

Sladjana Petrovic, 60, was last seen leaving her apartment on 53rd Street in downtown Yellowknife on Dec. 26, according to police. She was reported missing the following day, when she didn't appear at the Salvation Army for medication she used to treat depression. ""We're still running into people who haven't heard that Sladjana is missing, and so we just thought we would try and do a bit more of a public awareness campaign over the next week or so,"" said Val Braden, one of Sladjana's friends.  ""We're going to be out in front of the post office today over the noon hour just with a big poster there, and we have some buttons to hand out just to keep her name and face in people's minds.""  RCMP describe Petrovic as white and 5'7"" with a heavy build and shoulder-length grey and brown hair and blue eyes.   Though the ground search is over, police on Monday said their missing person investigation remains ""open and active.""  Police said previously that they have no evidence to suggest foul play is a factor in Petrovic's disappearance.  While they wait for more news, friends of Petrovic plan to hand out buttons in higher-traffic areas of Yellowknife.

""Whatever assistance we have available and we can mobilize on the ground will happen,"" said O'Regan, who is also the MP for St. John's South-Mount Pearl. Speaking from a federal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, O'Regan said additional details regarding the mobilization of the Canadian Armed Forces will come once the two federal ministers tasked with the assistance — Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair and National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan — arrive in Winnipeg. Blair is expected to address the media on Sunday morning. ""The Government Operations Centre has staff working to coordinate the federal response to the situation in Newfoundland and Labrador,"" Blair said in a statement issued Saturday night. ""Canadians can be assured that all levels of government are working together to deliver the required help."" The primary task of the army, as well as reservists already in the province, will be clearing snow, O'Regan said. ""We'll be able to relieve operators who have been out there for a long time,"" he said. ""Workers in the hospital, some going on 36, 38 hours and need to be relieved. We need to get professionals back into the hospital."" O'Regan added that a ban on dumping snow into the harbour in St. John's was lifted yesterday in order to address the massive pileup of snow. He said the federal government would discuss with St. John's Mayor Danny Breen when to reimpose the ban, which was meant to address chemicals and salt polluting the harbour. Help is on the way.

233,Dominika Lirette,2020-01-17T06:12:37.452Z,"Gene Simmons dishes about a new music festival in Grand Forks, B.C., and his deep love of ketchup","When you think of the small southern Interior B.C. city of Grand Forks, Gene Simmons is probably not the first person who comes to mind. That may change now that the Kiss singer and bassist is launching a rock music festival, Titans of Rock, there this summer with Canadian producer Chuck Varabioff. The new festival running Aug. 6 to 8 will replace CannaFest, a music festival Varabioff used to throw in the area each year, which has showcased acts like the Beach Boys, Bret Michaels, Vince Neal and Cheap Trick. Simmons met Varabioff when he performed with The Gene Simmons Band at CannaFest in 2018, and they got to work planning Titans of Rock together. The lineup won't be announced for another few days, but the Kiss rocker said they're expecting 40,000 people to attend the three-day event, which he is set to host. Simmons called Radio West host Sarah Penton Thursday afternoon to chat about Grand Forks, the festival and some of his ""peculiar"" eating habits.  There are any number of places across North America you could have launched this festival. Tell me a little bit more about why Grand Forks? About a year and a half ago, Kiss took some time off and I didn't want to stop playing, so I put together [The Gene Simmons Band] and we played around. And I happened to play there, we headlined on one of the days. I had such a great time, more precisely Chuck and I connected.  What do you think it'll be like having a festival of this size in a place like Grand Forks? It's a better place than Woodstock was, that's in the backyard of a farmer who let his pigs take poops in the field. Right? Woodstock was nowhere. You couldn't get there. It was a one-lane highway, half a million people showed up. I like the mayor, and the local people, and because the folks at Grand Forks are making it financially feasible we can do the festival for pennies on the dollar than it would a normal festival. So you don't have to, as they say, get gouged by the prices or the price of food or hotels or anything, but obviously first-come, first-served.  This is going to be happening during a break from the Kiss tour and this is a big, long tour. How come you don't take more time off to sit by the pool or walk in nature? That's for losers. Champions and captains of industry, if you've got the DNA in your heart, if you're an A-type personality, you don't want to sit still. You're just waiting to die. Doctors will tell you, even if you're sitting around by the pool get up off your lazy ass and pump that heart. On the days when your heart's not pumping you're not doing yourself very much good. Are you doing it because you love it, because you believe you should, or both? Well, both. I'm a very blessed guy. I've got as they say, the life of Riley, I don't have to do anything. But so what? Get up. Do philanthropy. Go scale that mountain. Create jobs and do stuff, especially if you don't have to. You know, I don't have a problem going to sleep because my heart keeps pumping and then at night I'm exhausted. Can't wait to go to sleep. Anyone else put ice cubes in their cereal? <a href=""https://t.co/lfvZr5lBjk"">pic.twitter.com/lfvZr5lBjk</a> I have to ask you about the ice cubes and cereal. How long have you been doing that for? I wasn't born in America, I came from Israel and when I came to America as a child of eight-and-a-half years of age, I never had cereal and I fell in love with it, but the milk just never got cold enough. And so because I never tasted ketchup until I was eight-and-a-half or nine years of age, I'm also peculiar about ketchup I'm told, but I know what I like. Why are you peculiar about ketchup? Well, I have tuna sandwiches and put ketchup on that. When I first came to America I used to have ketchup sandwiches. We used to have Wonder Bread, which was just mushy, kind of closer to cake than bread, and I just put ketchup and salt and I'd eat that. I'd have scrambled eggs with ketchup on it. I put ketchup on everything. And when I went off on my own, and was scrounging around just to pay the bills and everything, I used to have — get ready for this — ketchup soup. I thought I was the only one that did that, but my Newfie wife said she did exactly the same thing.

That's when the federal government dedicated $27.5 million to fighting the disease in Inuit communities — she was not re-elected in 2019 and is no longer part of Canada's government.  She, alongside Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami president Natan Obed, announced the Liberal's plan to cut tuberculosis rates in Canada's four Inuit regions in half by 2025 and completely eliminated the disease five years after that. Philpott said at the time she was alarmed to see the rate of tuberculosis, or TB, among Inuit was 300 times that of non-Indigenous, Canadian-born citizens. Philpott told CBC Thursday she is equally alarmed that the rate has barely changed since then. Since 2009, 12 people who were sick with active tuberculosis in Nunavut have died.  ""This is one of our most serious domestic issues. It requires attention and it requires a budget,"" Philpott said.  The government of Nunavut spends around $10 million a year on treatment alone, but actively fighting the disease costs much more. Beginning in February 2018 three of the territory's 25 hamlets received community-wide screenings, in which almost every community member was tested. The price tag for those three interventions was nearly $6 million. The federal government covered the cost of the community screening clinics, but the funding has since dried up. Nunavut's chief public health officer, Dr. Michael Patterson, says he wants to run more clinics. ""If we are going to do community-wide screenings we need to have funding levels that are sustainable and predictable and we can run it as a program,"" Patterson said. And if the clinics don't continue, Patterson is unequivocal — tuberculosis will remain a problem. Officials at the Department of Indigenous Services say they are fully committed to supporting Nunavut's efforts, but the necessary funding has yet to materialize. Patterson said Nunavut's Department of Health is working with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated — the organization that represents Inuit in Nunavut — to develop a regional plan, which will be unveiled in March. He says he is hopeful that the federal government will make the necessary financial commitments by then. But there is a larger problem — clinics alone won't lead to the elimination of TB. ""TB numbers will drop but if we don't fix other problems — housing, food, employment — the numbers will come back,"" Patterson said.  The housing crisis among Inuit is a major factor in the spread of TB and addressing the current housing needs in Nunavut will cost more than a billion dollars. Philpott said it's time for Canadians to wake up to the fact that their fellow Canadians are dying as a result of underfunding. ""It comes time to put our money where our mouth is ... Canadians have not done what's right,"" Philpott said.  She said the answer is to create unavoidable political pressure, which will only happen when all Canadians make northern living conditions a priority.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tuberculosis-nunavut-philpott-update-1.5431199,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tuberculosis-philpott-obed-fight-1.4589028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/dene-nation-seeks-tb-treatment-apology-1.5430271,/news/canada/north/nanilavut-inuit-lost-loved-ones-1.5215116 /news/canada/north/nunavut-public-health-act-tracks-latent-tuberculosis-1.5428482 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/tb-still-a-killer-in-nunavut-as-health-workers-and-politicians-struggle-to-stop-the-outbreaks-1.4559587 /news/canada/north/nunavut-tb-rates-remain-high-1.5169300
235,Nancy Russell,2020-01-20T21:13:40.914Z,Admission rules could be changing for French schools on P.E.I.,"P.E.I.'s French Language School Board is considering changes to its admission policy after a significant growth in enrolments has put a strain on the Island's six French-language schools.  The French language student population on P.E.I. has surpassed 1,000, an increase of 22 per cent over the past five years, according to La Commission scolaire de langue française. That increase has brought some challenges, including financial ones, as schools try to provide resources for students who haven't acquired the language yet. In a news release following its monthly meeting, the board said it was revising its admission policy to ""better delineate access to non-rights holding parents."" Non-rights holding parents include immigrant parents, and others, who don't have a constitutional right to a French-language education under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Currently, those parents can apply for their children to attend a French-language school on P.E.I. ""Non-rights holders, if they they want to get in a French school, they have to go through an evaluation for that child,"" said Gilles Benoit, chair of the board. ""We are looking at that right now because we want to make sure if we open the door to more non-right holders, that we have the proper tools to evaluate those students to make sure they will have success in a French school."" The parents and students who are non-rights holders are supposed to be interviewed, to see if the parents can support the child and if the child can speak French, but the board said that wasn't always happening. ""We also have a situation where there's a lot more of immigrant students entering, that want to enter our school,"" Benoit said. ""Because they have the right to choose between French and English, so sometimes they don't have neither one of them and they want to choose French education. So we want to make sure that we will be able to accommodate them."" Benoit said some English students may qualify to attend a French-language school because they went through a daycare centre and can speak French, but he said that's not a very significant number.  The board estimated that non-rights holders make up two to three per cent of the current student population. ""If we are to open our schools to non-right holders, they will have to demonstrate that they are able to to communicate, to read and write in French,"" Benoit said. ""Because we want to make sure if we accept some students that they will succeed in their education. We don't want to have those students fail."" The board said there will also be changes for rights-holding families who are applying for a French-language school on P.E.I.  They will need to provide evidence of their French-language qualifications, proving that either their parents or grandparents are francophone or attended a French-language school. The revised policy will have its third reading during the board's March 10 meeting. The French Language School Board has set a goal of 1,500 students by 2026-27. The president of the Fédération des parents de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard, Melissa MacDonald, said she was a ""bit surprised"" by the news from the board.  She said these are important decisions that need to be discussed with school administrators, and hopes that administrators from every school will be involved in a decision that will affect them all.  The federation is going to discuss the issue at their next meeting on Feb. 7.  MacDonald said the federation finds the changes to be positive but wants to make sure they ""consider all the angles."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-schools-admission-policy-1.5433306,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-school-enrolment-1.5271293 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-school-board-deficit-1.5321551 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sunday-snow-storm-1.5432928 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-o-leary-house-fire-1.5432656,/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-superintendent-oct-2019-1.5327789 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-school-enrolment-1.5350031 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-french-driver-shortage-1.5356779 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-2020-capital-budget-%C3%A9cole-%C3%A9vang%C3%A9line-1.5360713
236,Richard Gleeson,2020-01-20T21:14:49.977Z,"N.W.T. courts' travel policy sets accused up to fail, defence lawyer says","A prominent Yellowknife defence lawyer is protesting a change in the application of a court travel policy that, he says, is going to leave people who have been released on bail either stuck in jail or homeless on the streets of Yellowknife. ""It does seem bizarre that you can get released to live on the streets in Yellowknife, but they're not prepared to ship you back to a community that is a safer place for you to be ... and it's - 40 C,"" said defence lawyer Peter Harte. Harte said, previously, the N.W.T. government would pay the airfare to transport people who have been released on bail to the community they're supposed to be staying in, under their bail conditions. Now, the N.W.T. government — with the courts setting up the travel arrangements — will only pay for airfare to the community where the alleged crime occurred, Harte said. Harte said he became aware of the change last week. For example, Harte said he is representing one man facing charges out of Fort Simpson, N.W.T. The man's bail was agreed to, on the condition he goes to Hay River. But with the way the policy is being applied, the government would only pay for airfare back for Fort Simpson, Harte said, even though it would cost less to fly the man to Hay River. On Friday, after Harte explained the situation his client was in, the warden of the North Slave Correctional Centre agreed to pay the cost of flying the man to Hay River out of the warden's budget. In another case currently before the courts, a man from the Beaufort Delta region is facing charges being dealt with in court in Inuvik. The court said he could be released on bail, on the condition that he goes to Yellowknife. However, the accused man cannot afford the airfare — approximately $500 — to return to Inuvik from Yellowknife. The courts have, so far, refused to help him, said Harte. If he does not make it back to Inuvik, he will likely be charged with failing to attend court and breaching his bail condition to attend court as required. He will end up being kept in jail until his case is concluded, according to Harte. It costs approximately $280 per day to house inmates in the N.W.T. Justice Department officials were not immediately available for comment.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-lawyers-defence-travel-policy-1.5431819,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/criticism-of-northern-prisoner-rehabilitation-1.5428702,/news/canada/north/vancouver-lawyer-fighting-to-keep-representing-nwt-legal-aid-clients-1.5306723 /news/canada/north/trauma-informed-justice-1.4815979
237,Anonymous,2020-01-19T18:14:17.166Z,Saskatchewan cold snap ending as temperatures set to climb,"Saskatchewan residents will soon get a reprieve from the wicked winter weather that has been walloping parts of the province. Environment Canada is forecasting that Saskatchewan will see temperatures change drastically in the coming days with some areas expected to reach temperatures above 0 C. For example, in Lucky Lake in Southwest Saskatchewan — where some of the largest changes are expected — it felt like -33 C with the windchill on Sunday morning, but Environment Canada is expecting the small community to be 2 C on Monday. On Sunday in Saskatoon it felt like -36 C with the windchill and in Regina it felt like -31 C. As the week starts however, those temperatures are set to rise, with Regina expected to see a high of -7 C on Monday and -1 C on Tuesday.  In the Bridge City temperatures are expected to hover between -4 C and -7 C throughout the week. ""It appears the cold snap is coming to an end,"" said David Carlsen, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.  He said Saskatchewan and Alberta have experienced frigid temperatures in recent days, as a cold air mass worked its way from the North Pole, Northern Canada and even Siberia into the prairies. Now, a warmer air mass coming off the Pacific is slowly working its way east, warming up parts of western Alberta on Saturday, where some areas saw temperatures go from -20 C to 2 C over the course of an hour. ""We're not going to see the switch in such a speedy fashion, but over a couple of hours we're still going to see temperatures go from the minus 20s to close to 0 tomorrow,"" he said. ""So it'll be a very noticeable change."" Carlsen said Sunday night will likely see the cold weather making an exit, and it's likely temperatures will actually rise overnight Sunday into Monday morning. ""Take what you've got today add 15 to 20 degrees and that's what you're looking at tomorrow,"" he said. Despite the arrival of warm weather, Carlsen said it's not likely Saskatchewan will see any records broken, but notes temperatures will be ""well above"" average. In Saskatoon, Carlsen said temperatures will be between five to eight degrees warmer than average and in Regina, temperatures will be off seasonal averages by eight to ten degrees. Carlsen said he doesn't expect any issues around flooding or melt water. He says while road conditions may improve in the coming days, it's important motorists are careful on morning and overnight commutes when moisture can re-freeze. The recent cold-snap was a record-breaker in at least one capacity, as SaskEnergy reported the province broke its record for natural gas consumption last week. Last week, the Crown Corporation said customers used 1.56 petajoules of natural gas, with one petajoule equalling one million gigajoules. The average home in Saskatchewan uses 100 gigajoules of natural gas every year. When asked to look ahead to the rest of the winter, Carlsen said temperatures will remain seasonal for the rest of the season, but noted it's tough to determine as the signals remain mixed.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/environment-canada-cold-snap-1.5432604,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/extreme-cold-warnings-blanket-saskatchewan-1.5427426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/indoor-dog-park-saskatoon-cold-weather-1.5427724 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/electric-cars-regina-cold-batteries-1.5429665 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskenergy-cold-1.5429163,[]
238,John Last,2020-01-20T14:53:30.449Z,Sahtú gathers in Colville Lake to develop new plan for caribou harvest,"For the next five days, Colville Lake, N.W.T., is the centre of the Sahtú. Leaders from across the region and the North are gathering in the community for a three-day public ""listening session"" on how to protect three of the territory's caribou herds. The hearing is the first of five tackling different topics related to caribou management, to be held in each of the Sahtú's communities. A tentative schedule indicates it might be five years until they're all done. The Bluenose West and Bluenose East barren ground caribou herds were the subject of conservation hearings in 2007 and 2016 respectively. The Northern Mountain herd, a species of woodland caribou, has been considered at risk since 2005. This week's hearing is the first time multiple herds will be discussed in a single session, according to Deborah Simmons, the executive director of the Sahtú Renewable Resources Board (SRRB), which organized the session. ""The board is aware of conservation concerns for all the kinds of caribou that are living in our Sahtú region,"" she said. ""We've broadened the net."" Simmons says the board is hoping the sessions are less rushed than those in 2016, and allow for a broader range of evidence that better reflects the experience of the communities that rely on the caribou and share a historic relationship with the herds. For Colville Lake Chief Wilbert Kochon, it's all ""one herd"" — but one in need of a new, less ""colonial"" approach to conservation. The hearing will open with the presentation of Colville Lake's locally drafted caribou management plan, which follows Délı̨nę's 2016 plan in basing conservation strategies on traditional Dene law. ""I'm hoping that … people will listen to what we're doing,"" said Kochon. The session is the first organized by the SRRB since 2016, when a hearing on the Bluenose East herd resulted in strict limits on harvests as the herd faced rapid population decline. Colville Lake criticized those limits at the time as ""racist and dangerous,"" arguing the cap wrongly blamed the herd's decline on Indigenous hunting, and ignored other influences like climate change, resource developments, and natural population cycles. That hearing also resulted in an endorsement for Délı̨nę's local management plan, which enforces traditional hunting methods and educates hunters on the sacred relationship between the community and the herd. Colville Lake's plan echoes Délı̨nę's in basing conservation controls on a traditional respect for the animals. It calls the existing system of tags and quotas an ""unprecedented colonial system of control and criminalization of Indigenous hunting."" ""For many years, [the Crown] thought that only their laws mattered,"" an advanced copy of Tuesday's presentation on the plan reads. ""Self-regulation in accordance with community conservation plans is a more effective means of conservation than Wildlife Act regulations and enforcement."" Since the 2016 hearing, the estimated size of the Bluenose East herd has dropped by nearly half, and the harvest has been capped at fewer than 200 animals.  But Kochon and other leaders have at times criticized the counting methods employed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The text of Colville Lake's plan suggests the department relies too heavily on population counts for assessing the overall health of the herd, a method it calls ""reactive"" and ""ineffective."" In its place, it proposes ""a more holistic and traditional approach to conservation … [based] on local and ground-based knowledge and advice, with the inclusion of science to fill gaps as deemed helpful."" Both the Délı̨nę and Colville Lake plans rely primarily on volunteer reporting to measure the health of the herd. That has led some wildlife authorities to criticize local renewable resource councils for the quality of the data they gather on annual harvests. In a submission to the hearing from the Wildlife Management Advisory Council of the N.W.T., Larry Carpenter, the chair, wrote that the council would ""limit their participation"" in the board's hearings until they received better data from the SRRB. Since a 2007 hearing on the Bluenose West herd, ""there have been no noticeable improvements in the sharing of harvest information from communities within the Sahtú with wildlife co-management partners,"" it reads. Improving how data on the herds and the harvest is shared between the dozen or so parties will be one major focus of the hearings, Simmons said. Colville Lake will not be alone in making the case for local management. They'll be supported by submissions from the Ross River Dena Council, which is fighting the Yukon government to establish a local licensing system for hunting caribou. But not every local authority is in opposition to the government. The session will also include remarks from the Inuvialuit Game Council, which has had a much more positive working history. ""We have a very robust monitoring system here in the [Inuvialuit Settlement Region] where we … abide by the letter of the law,"" said Vernon Amos, the chair of the Inuvialuit Game Council. ""We just want to … really try to reinforce that they should be following that too and abiding with the rules and regulations."" Both the Environment Department and local authorities agree Indigenous knowledge should play a much larger role in guiding conservation efforts. Both see hunter education as crucial to ensuring the traditional respect survives. Ultimately, what the SRRB heard in their listening session won't be clear until March 31, when it releases its list of resulting decisions. It could be a long time until those decisions have an effect. More than four years on from Délı̨nę's plan, the Environment Department is still ""consider[ing] the issue"" of amending the Wildlife Act to incorporate the plan, according to a submission to the hearing. ""We do know that there are some urgent decisions that need to be made,"" said Simmons. ""If the process is rushed too much,"" she said, ""the risk is that we don't have the evidence needed for decisions.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-hearings-colville-setup-1.5432768,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/ross-river-dena-hunting-permits-1.4841907 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-asks-for-change-bathurst-bluenose-east-caribou-1.5422078 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/conservation-workshop-colville-lake-1.5347681,/news/canada/north/southern-lakes-caribou-story-map-1.5415245 /news/canada/edmonton/alberta-caribou-wolf-grande-cache-1.5420891 /news/canada/north/contaminants-study-old-crow-1.5431040
239,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-05-18T21:20:39.025Z,Weight loss 'grants' program fails to pay up after participants shed pounds,"This story has been updated to reflect responses from Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization which were posted on their websites after publication of this story.  The ads ran across the country — get paid to lose weight — enticing many Canadians trying to shed pounds to sign up. Go Public has been flooded with messages from some who say when it came time to deliver, the so-called Weight Loss Grants Program wouldn't pay out, or dragged customer claims out for months before cutting a cheque. During our investigation, we heard from dozens of dissatisfied customers unhappy with the program run by a private, for-profit company. Some thought, because of its name, it was a government-run program issuing ""grants."" The Weight Loss Grants Organization now has a notice on its website that the grants program ""has now concluded.""  ""It's good for the consumer,"" said Richel Prevost, of Calgary, who heard about the program on the radio two years ago. At the time, Prevost, 5'6"", was tipping the scales at over 200 pounds and desperate to lose weight.  She thought she'd found the solution — a grant program that would give her access to a high-end diet program then reimburse her for up to 80 per cent of the cost when she lost the weight. She was wrong.  ""I literally worked my butt off and I just don't feel like their end of the bargain is being held up,"" Prevost said. She signed up in September 2017 and paid $2,400 up front to the diet clinic the grants company recommended. She said she was told if she used Dalewood Health Clinic she'd get up to 80 per cent back in a grant, up to 20 per cent if she used a different one.  Prevost said she lost 50 pounds on her own through diet and exercise and reached her weight loss goal five months early. A year later, she is still trying to collect her grant.  ""It felt like they were moving the goalposts,"" Prevost said.""Every time that they asked for something different I complied."" Her grant was recently denied based on a rule that didn't exist when she lost the weight.  The Weight Loss Grants Organization told Go Public Prevost won't be getting her grant because she recorded her final weight five months early instead of on the exact deadline date. That rule was introduced in April, long after Prevost finished the program and submitted her paperwork. ""You can't change the rules like that in the middle and deny me my claim based on something that you implemented after the fact,"" Prevost said.  Jenn Granger from Calgary paid Dalewood $2,100, lost weight, and met all the requirements in October. Her grant was also denied based on the rule that kicked in last month. ""I'm not sure how we would possibly be able to follow such a rule when I submitted [for the grant] six months before they made the change,"" Granger wrote Go Public in an email. The Weight Loss Grants Organization didn't respond when Go Public asked how a new rule can apply to old cases. David Stein, who describes himself as the adjudicator at the Weight Loss Grants Organization, said Granger's grant was denied because the letter she submitted from the medical clinic to prove her weight loss ""does not appear to be legitimate.""  Go Public spoke with some people who say they did get their grants. The Weight Loss Grants Organization's website has a long list of thank-you letters from participants who say the program helped them lose weight.  Those letters are a requirement before the company will even consider paying out a grant.  Larry Smith said he wrote a thank-you letter and last August and received an email saying his $1,920 grant was approved but after months passed with no payout, Smith contacted Go Public. Stein said Smith hasn't received a cheque because he failed to get a required letter from his doctor. No one from the company told Smith. The Better Business Bureau of Central Ontario has given the Weight Loss Grants Organization an ""F"" and Dalewood a ""D"" rating due to the high number of customer complaints. ""Consumers feel like they've achieved the requirements of the grants but for what might be a technical reason, they're not getting the grant at the end,"" said spokesperson Patrick McKeen. Dalewood is now in the process of changing its name to Trillium Weight Loss. It turns out Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are connected. Go Public found the two companies shared an address for years and have a senior manager who works for both companies. In emails and letters to clients, George Scodras refers to himself as the director of operations of Dalewood and of the Weight Loss Grants Program. He was also listed as director of operations for Dalewood on its website, until Go Public started asking questions about his connection to both companies.  All references to Scodras have since been removed from the Dalewood website, while the Trillium website lists him as a ""managing consultant.""  We asked the Weight Loss Grants Organization how much it has paid out in grants since the program started in 2015, and why so many people have complained about not getting money they thought they were due.  ""The total number of grants paid out as of April 30th, 2019, is $733,552.71 (according to info given to me),"" Dalewood spokesperson Marissa Mayles wrote in an email to Go Public. That number can't be verified, but Go Public did speak with other former customers who say they got their full grants after using Dalewood. Clients say they weren't told about any connections between the Weight Loss Grants Program and Dalewood when they signed up. In an email to Go Public, Mayles said, ""we do not feel that there is a conflict of interest … Nobody is obligated to sign up with Dalewood and they can go wherever they like to lose their weight."" Mayles didn't give her exact title, but said she works in the finance and administration departments at Dalewood.  She is also the wife of the company's founder, Darren Morgenstern, who also founded Ashley Madison, the adulterous dating site with the slogan ""Life is short. Have an affair."" Morgenstern sold Ashley Madison in 2007.  Mayles said Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are not connected but, ""the owners are all connected and know each other well and the relationships predate either business."" As for Scodras, she said he's not an employee of either Dalewood or the Weight Loss Grants Organization but ""a temporary consultant ... an impartial disinterested party that is acting on behalf of all parties, including grant applicants.""  Stein said the Weight Loss Grants Organization will continue to honour ""legitimate grant requests,"" even though the program has been shut down. ""There have been too many problems which began for us late last year when we had to start enforcing our rules and having zero tolerance for improper documents, but we had no choice as there were far too many bogus grant claims,"" he told Go Public. The grants company has posted a reaction to Go Public's story on its website. The Dalewood and Trillium websites both have postings saying they're no longer accepting new clients affiliated with the Weight Loss Grants Organization. Prevost said she plans to file a fraud report with police and may try to take the company to court. ""I am not in a position to lose $2,000,"" she said, ""The reason I did this is because I thought I was going to get my money back ... this is crazy.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

240,Neil Macdonald,2019-12-17T09:00:00.948Z,Why are photo ops (except Trump's) so brutally boring?: Neil Macdonald,"Any reporter who's ever covered the Middle East can tell you about the Arab leader photo op. It is one of the most curious acts of solipsism ever invented. The beloved leader-for-life, a king or a president, always a man, appears on some hideous filigreed-and-gilded couch or chair, chatting with an important visitor. Maybe sweet tea is served. No questions are allowed. That's it. Lickspittle journalists from the state-controlled media are invited to record the event (usually, no audio is permitted), which is then broadcast at the top of the evening newscast, with gushing narration about the awe and respect and deference shown the leader by his important visitor. I've seen Jordanian television lead its newscast with three identical, consecutive scenes, all on the same royal couch. It's hilarious, and most Western reporters cackle sarcastically when they first see it. I certainly did. In reality, though, photo ops in our democracies aren't much different. Politicians pose and grip and grin, and mouth blandishments, and, like the beloved Arab leaders, are careful to say nothing.  The prime photo op directive, it seems, is to say absolutely nothing. The only difference in the West is that leaders don't order journalists to turn off the audio. (I'll bet they would if they could). So reporters scrutinize faces for the slightest flicker of authenticity. Did the Italian PM roll his eyes for a moment? Did Angela Merkel seem to suppress a snicker? Did Melania Trump look exhausted and scared? The exception, of course, is Donald Trump. No need to examine him for tells or tics. Ever since his elevation by the American public he represents so perfectly, he's been barging into photo ops, elbowing his way to the front, running his mouth, looking desperately bored when anyone else is speaking, using other leaders as props, and disrupting everything. I love it. After a lifetime of suffering through photo ops, it's refreshing. Trump might have a mouth like an open sewer, but at least he says something. Watching him crash around NATO's 75th anniversary get-together earlier this month was particularly enjoyable. He turned a photo op with NATO's obsequious secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, into a 52-minute news conference starring himself, bellyaching about Congressional Democrats. He then did the same thing to French president Emmanuel Macron, beside whom he held court for 41 minutes, telling Macron he should take back French citizens who went off to fight for ISIS and are now stranded in detention camps in Syria. ""Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?"" he asked Macron. ""I could give them to you."" Macron sputtered that Trump should be serious, and that foreign fighters are a tiny part of a big problem. It was fascinating: problems normally handled quietly by diplomats, erupting like burst pimples, right out in the open. During Trump's relatively brief 35 minutes with Justin Trudeau, he bluntly asked our prime minister, in front of everybody, why Canada isn't contributing two per cent of GDP to NATO, as required. Actually, asked Trump, ""What are you at? What's your number?"" Trudeau flailed, tried a little boring message track about his government's commitment to raise defence spending (I was sure he was going to start talking about helping the middle class), and finally, after consulting with his retinue, replied 1.4 per cent.  Well, maybe Canada should be put on a payment plan, gloated Trump. It was those Trump performances that Trudeau and Macron were giggling about at a reception later, when they were caught on camera with the audio turned on. The video went viral, and made headlines, because it was normally scripted leaders caught in a rare moment of honesty. Trump, on the other hand, prefers making fun of people to their faces. A colleague, after watching the NATO coverage for a few days, wrote me asking: ""Why don't more politicians besides an old white racist use these deadly dull canned moments to actually say something?"" Good question. Great question, really. Instead of sniggering at receptions, why don't our leaders stop behaving like wax sculptures of themselves? Wouldn't it have been wonderful, when Trump started bitching about Canada's NATO contribution, if Trudeau had had the bottle to say something like: ""Sure, let's talk about American military leadership. Your country invaded Iraq based on a lie, solved nothing, and caused not only hundreds of thousands of deaths, but created ISIS. And now we're learning from your own government correspondence that you had no idea what you were doing in Afghanistan, a mess you actually managed to drag Canada into, and we all spent a lot of blood and treasure for nothing. Great job, Mr. President. Everybody's impressed."" Or, when Trump made his smarty-pants offer to send France some nice ISIS fighters, if Macron had replied: ""Really? Well, let's talk about that. You've been dumping your own prisoners on another country's soil, and holding them indefinitely without due process. Your country has also practised torture as an official policy, and you just pardoned three war criminals. Spare me, Mr. President. Also, and I say this as a Frenchman, your long-tie look is ridiculous."" Instead, the posing and empty statements live on, and will be happening long after Trump lurches off to enjoy the money his resorts have raked in during his presidency. Why does such photo-op mummery persist? Vanity and fear, I'd submit. Some of our leaders, like the Arab potentates, actually think they're so interesting they need only mouth pleasantries to make people listen in fascination. Others take refuge in scripted replies and posed photo ops because they're afraid, probably with good reason, that they'll say something stupid. But Trump has made that all right. Hasn't he? *** Author's Note: A rather doleful column I wrote last September about wrestling with a decision on whether to have surgery done on my Border Collie pup Lola, after we discovered she'd been born with hip dysplasia, generated an awful lot of response from commiserating dog-owners. I can report that we went ahead and basically had her hip joints removed that month, and that she has recovered brilliantly, and now runs like the wind. She's young and light and flexible and athletic, just like me, and that apparently made all the difference. As did post-op laser therapy and underwater treadmill exercise.

241,Peter Mills,2018-10-20T11:00:00.566Z,Roughriders long snapper Jorgen Hus goes from 'awful' to outstanding,"This piece was originally published on Oct. 20, 2018. Life isn't easy for a CFL long snapper. If you do your job perfectly every time, very few people will ever notice you. But if you make one mistake, it could cost you a job. Saskatoon's Jorgen Hus knows that reality well. The 29-year-old is in his fourth season as the Saskatchewan Roughriders long snapper and you'd be hard-pressed to think of a time he made a mistake snapping the football. Before joining the Riders, Hus' ability to master the craft of long snapping was noticed by multiple NFL teams. For more on his journey from Saskatoon to Regina to the NFL and back to Saskatchewan, Jorgen Hus spoke to CBC's Peter Mills: Most players I've interviewed recently are from places like Bessemer, Alabama or Winston-Salem, North Carolina, but you're just down the road in Saskatoon. What was it like growing up? Yeah, just up the number 11 [highway]. It's always been a dream to be a Roughrider, of course, growing up in the province and being from here. So just worked hard and coaches always said growing up, ""If you want to have a long career, learn how to snap."" It's something I always took seriously, along with playing linebacker. I always worked hard on snapping on the side and eventually it just panned out for me. I try and tell every young kid, ""Learn how to snap."" If you learn how to snap, you can still do your regular position but it's something that will always help you make that next team. I heard you say once that you started as an 'awful' football player. Is that true? Oh yeah. I started late. Grade 9 was when I first started playing football and I was awful. I was scared to be on the field. I didn't want any part of it. But I loved the team aspect of it and that's kind of what kept me through it and eventually I just fell in love with the game, worked hard, got in the weight room, got a little bigger, and then the game became more fun. What do you think was the biggest thing to get you to the next level? I think it's a combination of a few things. Working hard, doing all the things around the clock right and then just thinking outside the box. I went to a couple of [NFL] camps down south to get some exposure and that's kind of what got my career kick started: spending time with the [St. Louis] Rams, and the [Seattle] Seahawks, and the [Kansas City] Chiefs, and then coming here and being here the past four years, which has nothing but a dream come true. Thanks everyone who attended and helped in making my first annual Charity Long Snapping Camp a success! <a href=""https://twitter.com/WaterboysORG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WaterboysORG</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/SaskHilltops?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@SaskHilltops</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/G_Newms?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@G_Newms</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/stjguardians?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@stjguardians</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/sskroughriders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@sskroughriders</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/reginarams?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@reginarams</a> <a href=""https://t.co/KKhsjZZbgs"">pic.twitter.com/KKhsjZZbgs</a> You said you started in Grade 9. St. Joe's? St. Joseph High School, yup, represent. Guardians, let's go! You played with the Saskatoon Hilltops first. How did you end up going to the University of Regina? I never really ended up talking with the [University of Saskatchewan] Huskies. It was just kind of something that never really happened. The [Regina] Rams ended up calling me one Sunday morning and I had a good chat with [former Rams head coach] Frank [McCrystal]. I came down for a visit and I really liked it. Me and [former Hilltops and Rams punter] Chris Bodnar ... we were best buddies and we both came down at the same time and we had a fun career together. How influential was going to the U of R in terms of setting you up to got to the NFL and your professional career? It helped a lot. Frank was really, really well at helping get guys out there, getting you noticed, and doing everything he can to support a pro career. I gotta thank Frank a lot for what's happened in my career. He's certainly been a huge help. Big Thanks to the <a href=""https://twitter.com/reginarams?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@reginarams</a> for the sweet gear!! Much appreciated! <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ramnation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ramnation</a> <a href=""https://t.co/9GUrywASiz"">pic.twitter.com/9GUrywASiz</a> So you graduate from the U of R and the NFL comes calling. What will you remember most from your time with NFL teams? Probably just the guys in the locker room. Of course, some coaching. Playing against Peyton Manning, that was the highlight I'd say. [Manning was] playing in Denver, you know, that year he broke all those records in 2013, it was just the coolest thing. I don't think I sat down at all once during that game. When their offense was on the field, my toes were right on the edge of the sideline watching because I was a huge Peyton Manning fan growing up. You had a Peyton Manning jersey, didn't you? Yeah, yeah. Huge fan, got his jersey. I thought that was pretty cool and I snapped a really good game that game as well so it was probably the highlight. Couple <a href=""https://twitter.com/reginarams?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@reginarams</a> squaring off! <a href=""https://twitter.com/The_Dream99?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@The_Dream99</a> <a href=""http://t.co/OTgTkgN05p"">pic.twitter.com/OTgTkgN05p</a> The last time I interviewed you was in 2013 and I asked if you thought your time in the NFL would help U of R and U of S players get more exposure, And you said 'I think Brett Jones can certainly play. Along with Ben Heenan.' Well, both ended up going to the NFL. How big is that for Saskatchewan football? It's huge. And there are certainly more guys who can play. It's one of those things where I think every year Canadians are getting more exposure. Teams are coming up here, their scouts are coming up here now. The pipeline is established. There's guys that can play. Jon Ryan helped, [Jordan] Sisco, those guys all had a major impact on it. The pipeline for Canadians going down there is better than it's ever been and it's just going to continue to grow. Do former Regina Rams guys have a bit of a chip on their shoulder when they talk to other Canadian university veterans? Do you say, 'Hey, we have more NFL players than you do'? Yeah, I've definitely had that conversation a few times. Any time we got a shot on someone we'll take it. You've said you don't like it necessarily when people are talking about you because it means you made a mistake. But it's the opposite when you're making big tackles downfield like you have this season. Is it a good thing for people to be talking about you now? Like you said, I hate being talked about, I just want to be kind of under the radar and not talked about at all. But if you're making tackles it's a good thing. We've had a lot of success on our punt team this year and hopefully we can keep it up and get a few more tackles in.  That's something you always did with the Regina Rams but it seems like you have an extra chip on your shoulder this season. Yeah, you know, it's my fourth year, I feel like my body is at a better composition than it's ever been, and I'm feeling better. I've felt younger this year. A lot of things have been going right and I just feel faster and it's been a healthy year so knock on wood, hopefully it keeps up.

I'm part of the Imagine No Bullying campaign with the Red Cross. Me and a few other guys on the team — Spencer Moore, Eddie Steele, and Dan Clark — we travel around to schools all over the province and we talk about healthy relationships and respect and some anti-bullying stuff. We've pretty much covered ever inch of this province, we've even gone as far as Nunavut to talk to kids up there. It's something we really look forward to and enjoy doing in the off-season and it also works well with training. Were you bullied growing up? I was not. I've had really close friends that were [bullied]. I mean, I've heard things I wish I hadn't, as I think everybody has at some point in time in their life but nothing consistently. But I've seen the impacts of it up close and bullying effects everybody in some shape or form, so it's something that we certainly enjoy and take seriously.

How did you get into that? I was just kind of looking for careers that work well with football and I thought mortgage broking would do that. You can travel around, you can be on the go, and you can get stuff done. I thought it works hand-in-hand with football and I thought the exposure might help a little bit too.  Are you making a pitch to some of your new teammates that you'll help them find a place? Absolutely. Yeah, I talked to a couple guys on the plane last week [laughs]. So I'll try and keep that up.

243,Betsy Trumpener,2020-01-18T21:23:48.184Z,Aspiring hip-hop musician wants to inspire Indigenous youth with 'reality rap' from northern B.C. ,"An aspiring musician hopes his ""reality rap,"" rooted in northern B.C., will inspire Indigenous youth.  ""I grew up in the 'hood and the reservation,"" Dino Alec told CBC. ""Now people say I ... give them hope."" By day, Alec, 25, works as a carpentry apprentice at the Site C dam mega project. By night, he's a rapper with the stage name 2sockZ. Active on social media, 2sockZ was already a fan favourite at one of his first rap shows late last year.   Inside a packed Prince George nightclub, 2sockZ sported a baseball cap and two long, black braids. As he grabbed the microphone, a crowd of young people pressed toward him, chanting his name.  ""The crowd was awesome,"" said 2sockZ. ""I was so nervous right before I went on ... all the chanting started and it was just unbelievable. It was a blessing."" Alec's father was there, too, one of the oldest people dancing in the crowd. His presence was significant, because Alec's father's old cassette player played a role in his musical development. ""When I was growing up, I used to stay with my dad in the summertime on the Tachet reserve,"" said Alec. ""He used to have this old cassette player and we'd be able to record over blank tapes So, I'd take beats and listen and then I'd rap in to the tape recorder. I'd play it back and listen to myself on tape."" Now, Alec raps from his reality. His lyrics draw from his life on the Lake Babine First Nation and in Prince George's inner city. ""The [inner city] was partying and drinking, doing drugs, selling drugs,"" said Alec. ""I was in the 'hood and the gang lifestyle."" Now, Alec says he's sober, and pouring his energy into hip hop. He's writes songs, performs as much as he can, and posts his hip-hop videos online. The videos capture him rapping at local spots like the streets he grew up on and outside the Value Village where he shopped as a child. Alec sees his music as a representation of his life and the continuation of a long tradition. ""Music itself is very strong in my culture,"" he said. ""One of my grandpas was very heavily involved in that culture of traditionally singing and traditionally dancing. This is my way of using that background to pursue my music,"" he said.  ""I like to show my pride in my people,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/aspiring-hip-hop-musician-wants-to-inspire-indigenous-youth-with-reality-rap-from-northern-b-c-1.5429539,[],http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/no-phone-bill-telus-5000-1.5428591 /news/canada/british-columbia/bmo-indigenous-advisory-council-created-after-grandfather-12-year-old-handcuffed-at-brach-1.5429347 /news/canada/british-columbia/metro-vancouver-weather-jan-16-1.5428885
244,Angela Sterritt,2020-01-21T01:19:43.440Z,'I try my hardest not to think about it': 12-year-old recounts handcuffing at BMO,"The 12-year-old Indigenous girl who was handcuffed and then detained for 45 minutes by the Vancouver Police Department on a downtown street Dec. 20 after trying to open an account at the Bank of Montreal says she doesn't even want to think about what happened anymore. ""I was scared,"" Tori-Anne said Monday. ""The whole thing being handcuffed, after all the identification we showed that we are who we are."" CBC News has decided not to publish the girl's last name. ""I try my hardest not to think about it,"" she said from a Vancouver lawyer's office. Her grandfather, Maxwell Johnson, is looking into a human rights case that would address both the police and BMO's actions. Tori-Anne says that when she saw the police inside the bank, she got nervous. ""I kinda figured they thought we were trying to do something,"" she said. Police detained the two after a BMO employee called 911. The employee had difficulty validating their identification — government-issued Indian Status cards — according to Cameron Fowler, president of personal banking, BMO Financial Group. The bank has apologized, and the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner is now investigating the police department's detention and restraining of the pair. Tori-Anne and her grandfather are now fearful of police and of banks, but in particular of the Bank of Montreal, even just driving past it, he said. Both Johnson and his granddaughter live in the Heiltsuk community of Bella Bella, located on B.C's Central Coast. The Heiltsuk Tribal Council Chief Marilyn Slett says she was shocked to hear about what happened. ""I couldn't believe it actually happened,"" Slett said. ""it was too unreal to believe,"" she added. She also added that Indigenous people experience subtle racism everyday, but says this was an exception.  ""This is the extreme, but certainly what led the bank to make that call was racial profiling — was the stereotypes of Indigenous people,"" Slett said. Johnson said the whole incident traumatized him and his granddaughter and brought his memories of Indigenous people being taken away as children by the RCMP. ""It's unbelievable. It just brought back memories of handcuffing younger kids at residential school,"" Johnson said. He said Police Chief Adam Palmer was wrong to say police had the right to handcuff the two. ""We were calm, we were not making any fuss or anything — if it was non-native grandfather and granddaughter, I don't think they would have done that,"" he said.  He is confident the police and the bank were racially profiling them.  Tori-Anne said she was trying to open a bank account so that her grandfather could e-transfer money to her when she is on the road during basketball games and cultural events. Both Johnson and Tori-Anne are now undergoing counselling to deal with the trauma they say this situation has caused. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/12-year-old-indigenous-girl-recounts-handcuffing-at-bmo-1.5433662,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/indigenous-girl-grandfather-handcuffed-bank-1.5419519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bmo-indigenous-advisory-council-created-after-grandfather-12-year-old-handcuffed-at-brach-1.5429347 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/police-complaint-commissioner-investigation-detention-of-indigenous-12-year-old-and-grandfather-1.5426599,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149 /news/canada/british-columbia/swartz-bay-ferry-terminal-protest-1.5433100 /news/canada/british-columbia/rcmp-seeking-identify-fraud-suspects-1.5433589
245,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-20T09:00:00.676Z,Want to understand Hydro-Québec's Mactaquac plan? Look south of the border,"It's back. A decade after Hydro-Québec's plan to buy NB Power collapsed, the giant utility next door is once again turning its ambitious gaze toward New Brunswick's energy grid.  Its commitment to help refurbish the Mactaquac Dam near Fredericton, and to sell more electricity to New Brunswick, grabbed the most attention earlier this month. But a third deal, a promise to look at building new transmission links, is the real breakthrough for the Quebec utility, analysts say. Hydro-Québec has more electricity than residents of that province can use. It built four new large dams over the last 11 years, leaving it with an unexpected supply of excess electricity it must sell to avoid the dams becoming white elephants. ""We have both new supply of electricity, and the demand in Quebec for the last 10 years mostly remained stable,"" says Pierre-Olivier Pineau, the research chair in energy sector management at HEC Montreal, a graduate-level business university. ""There's a lot of water in Hydro-Québec's reservoirs.""  New Brunswick represents a convenient nearby buyer for that cheap, clean electricity, but also a potential path to even larger, more lucrative markets. NB Power has two transmission connections to Maine it already uses to sell power into New England, and there's enough room on those lines to carry more electricity, from here or from Quebec, than is being exported now. For Jack Keir, the former Liberal energy minister who promoted the 2009 sale agreement to a reluctant public, the same logic underlying that deal is driving the new negotiations. ""I believed in 2009 when we started looking at it, as I do today, [that] it's the right thing to do that we get our electricity as cheaply as we can, and that New Brunswick is located in the perfect spot to feed all of Atlantic Canada and the northeastern United States,"" he said. ""I applaud the Higgs government for looking at it."" NB Power and Hydro-Québec announced three agreements on Jan. 10. The Quebec utility will advise NB Power on how to refurbish the Mactaquac Dam and sell New Brunswick 47 terawatt-hours of electricity between now and 2040, extending an existing supply deal. A terawatt is one trillion watts. The third agreement, to explore the new transmission links, opens new paths for Quebec's surplus electricity to the Maritimes and beyond, according to Hydro-Québec CEO Éric Martel. ""We have some surplus, we have some capability, and together with this interconnection, we will definitely offer more opportunity to the Maritimes but also to the U.S. market,"" he said. Acquiring New Brunswick's transmission links to New England were widely seen as Hydro-Québec's primary strategic goal when it tried to buy NB Power 10 years ago. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams accused Quebec of trying to block his province's future electricity exports from the proposed Muskrat Falls dam to the U.S. Quebec was seeking ""energy control of the entire Maritime provinces"" and ""attempting to strand Newfoundland and Labrador,"" he said at the time.  The sale agreement fell apart, but a decade later, Hydro-Québec's push for more export sales is more urgent than ever.  Three of the massive dams have gone into service in the past five years. A fourth begins operating next year. They were approved when energy prices were high and demand within Quebec was expected to grow. But prices are down and demand in the province has flatlined. ""We've plateaued,"" Martel told the Financial Post in 2018. ""This is putting a lot of pressure on our financials."" The solution: more exports. ""At this point Hydro-Québec is pursuing export projects in all directions, to Ontario, to New York, to New England and all the Atlantic provinces,"" Pineau said. ""They know that maybe not all the contracts will work, so they try to develop as much as they can."" The U.S. northeast is the biggest potential market. Politicians and regulators don't want energy that emits carbon dioxide. A bill in the Massachusetts legislature would require 100 per cent renewable power in the state by 2045. But getting more Quebec electricity there has not been straightforward.  A proposed Hydro-Québec transmission link through New Hampshire called the Northern Pass was blocked by state regulators over concern towers and cables would cross the White Mountains National Forest. In Maine, another route called Clean Energy Connect will be put to voters in a referendum in November. Pineau isn't convinced these obstacles to the New England market are Hydro-Québec's main reason for cozying up to New Brunswick again. He said it's more likely driven by the business opportunity to export more power here and to Nova Scotia, which has four coal-fired plants. But Keir believes the strategic ambition that drove Hydro-Québec's attempt to buy NB Power 10 years ago is at work again now. ""We're a straight line for them down to New England,"" Keir said. Keir still defends that sale agreement, arguing New Brunswick would have acquired more benefits from it than what's on the table now: the elimination of $5 billion in NB Power debt; the cost of refurbishing Mactaquac taken on by Hydro-Québec, and power rates reduced for industry and frozen for residents.  That wasn't enough to win over New Brunswickers, who mostly opposed the sale. This time, Hydro-Québec's incursion hasn't stirred nearly the same emotions. ""Because we've already been through this once, it's somewhat less shocking the second time, and frankly, let's be honest here: they're not selling anything, so folks aren't as passionate,"" Keir said. ""Back then folks really believed we were giving up our sovereignty and a huge asset that we had. It was very difficult to convince folks otherwise. Now that's not even an argument coming into play here."" There have been other major shifts since a decade ago, the largest being climate change emerging as a major policy priority. Ottawa has new regulations to limit carbon emissions and ""we have to comply,"" said Louise Comeau, director of the Environment and Sustainable Development Research Centre at the University of New Brunswick.  The Quebec-New Brunswick deal could be a forerunner of a broader plan to integrate five provincial grids, allowing hydro dams in Quebec and Labrador to displace coal and fuel oil as a source of electricity generation, she said. ""Why don't we work together on a plan, a complete plan to serve 100 per cent of clean energy to all our provinces?"" Quebec Premier Francois Legault said last week. While New Brunswick is looking to sign an equivalency agreement with Ottawa that would allow NB Power's Belledune power plant to continue using some coal past a 2030 federal phase-out, Premier Blaine Higgs raised the possibility the plant could close.  Keir said the discussion about Belledune is more muted than it was in 2009, a sign of climate change becoming a bigger concern. ""There was a lot of screaming about that at the time and now I don't hear so much, because now everybody I guess believes this is real and it's going to have to close down,"" he said. Another change is the role of Newfoundland and Labrador. Back then, Muskrat Falls was just a dream and then-premier Danny Williams was adamant that Hydro-Québec could not be allowed to block its future export route to New England.  Now, the Labrador dam is set to go online, ""so they're in the market like Quebec is,"" Keir said. ""So it's important for Newfoundland now to have that capacity to go somewhere. Back then it wasn't."" And to get that electricity to the U.S., ""the best path is through Quebec and New Brunswick,"" NB Power CEO Gaetan Thomas said at the Mactaquac news conference. Ottawa's climate plan includes funding for exactly the kind of new regional transmission links Hydro-Québec and NB Power want to build, making such projects more affordable. ""They've been pushing the Atlantic provinces to collaborate,"" Comeau said. ""This conversation represents a conversation the federal government's been very interested in encouraging."" Pineau said with four small Atlantic provinces with their own grids, and Quebec next door, co-operation is the best way to build an efficient, zero-emission regional system. ""There are a lot of significant gains to be made, especially in a context where we want to have more clean energy."" There are still major questions about all the potential integration. Keir points out Quebec would have to bid to use any new transmission line capacity in New Brunswick.   ""It can't just be given to Quebec unless they change that legislation."" Comeau said it's important for New Brunswick to keep generating its own power, including more solar and wind power, with Hydro-Québec acting as more of a backstop.  ""We need to watch that balance between how much we're relying on external sources of energy and our domestic supply,"" she said. But with Hydro-Québec's supply agreement with NB Power expiring in 2040, and the Churchill Falls contract with Quebec ending a year later, ""we can see an opening here for an opportunity not just regionally in Canada but within the New England system,"" she said. ""A regional, a truly regional, New England-and-Atlantic system I suspect will likely emerge.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/hydro-quebec-mactaquac-analysis-1.5432123,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-transmission-lines-atlantic-premiers-1.5425440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-hydro-quebec-mactaquac-1.5421849,/news/canada/new-brunswick/higgs-transmission-lines-atlantic-premiers-1.5425440 /news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-hydro-quebec-mactaquac-1.5421849

But Canada's top men's tennis player hasn't enjoyed much success at Grand Slams recently. He has lost in the first round in three of the past four majors. Shapovalov made 62 unforced errors, 27 more than his opponent. Fucsovics also fought off six of seven break points.

""So it's just about learning, going forward, and obviously it's a really disappointing one but there's nothing to do now but learn from it."" Shapovalov and Fucsovics, ranked 67th on the ATP Tour, had never squared off before Monday. Fucsovics has played spoiler at the Australian Open before, stunning 13th seed Sam Querrey of the United States in 2018. ""Usually this is not a lucky number, but for me, (13 is) my favourite number,"" said Fucsovics. ""I played some of my best tennis today. Everything was working well."" Fucsovics took an early 2-0 lead in the first set, using a deft touch on returns to work Shapovalov out of position. Although Shapovalov won the next game, Fucsovics continued to press and took the opening set 6-3. Shapovalov slammed his racket to the ground in frustration as Fucsovics took a 40-0 advantage with the second set tied 2-2. The outburst came after Shapovalov's 24th unforced error. An emotional Shapovalov yelled ""come on!"" to himself after powering a forehand past a running Fucsovics to tie the set up 3-3. The duo traded games twice to keep it even at 5-5. Shapovalov again threw his racket to the ground when his return went too deep, giving Fucsovics the advantage. On the next serve, Fucsovics won the game. Holding serve, Shapovalov powered back to force tiebreak. After a lengthy rally, Fucsovics sailed a return wide, giving Shapovalov an 8-7 lead and an opportunity at set point. Fucsovics double faulted for only the second time in the match to give Shapovalov the set. Still struggling with his emotions, Shapovalov quickly fell behind 5-1 in the third set. As Shapovalov continued to lose his composure, he double faulted to hand Fucsovics the set point. Shapovalov berated the umpire and received a code violation after the third set on Margaret Court Arena. After throwing his racket, Shapovalov was given the code violation that triggered his outburst. ""I didn't break it. If I break it, 100 per cent code me,"" Shapovalov yelled at umpire Renaud Lichtenstein. ""You're not doing your job. You're just finding reasons to code me."" Shapovalov jumped out to 2-0 and 3-1 leads in the fourth set but Fucsovics battled back to tie it 4-4 and take a 5-4 lead before Shapovalov evened it 5-5. The two traded games again to force tiebreak. Fucsovics sliced a backhand just out of Shapovalov's reach to take a 4-2 lead in the tiebreak after the Canadian had played close to the net to try and force play. Shapovalov went for the same strategy on the next point but it put him out of position for Fucsovics deep return to make it 5-2. On the next point, Shapovalov put the ball out for a 6-2 Fucsovics lead. Shapovalov won a point back before Fucsovics put the match away to complete the upset.

The council says heart disease and strokes are three times more likely to occur among smokers.  They're also up to four times more likely to experience sudden cardiac death.  Of the people who have heart bypass surgery, about 50 per cent have either smoked before or are current smokers, according to CHUM cardiac surgeon Joe Hélou.  ""It's a major public health issue because cigarette smoke tends to multiply the effects of other conditions that would cause coronary artery disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, genetic factors,"" Hélou said.  Helou says no matter how long you've been smoking, quitting can help reduce your health risks. Godin echoed that sentiment, encouraging people to quit as soon as they can — and not to get discouraged.  ""Quitting smoking is a difficult task because the cigarettes have … a strong hold,"" Godin said.  He recommended finding a physical activity to focus on instead.  ""Find something that you like,"" he said. ""Something that will drive you in a good way.

248,Julie Ireton,2020-01-17T16:49:00.456Z,Has this eastern Ontario startup created the firefighting product of the future?,"As Quincy Emmons and Zackery Hodgen watch the out-of-control bush fires burning in Australia, the two eastern Ontario firefighters believe they have a solution that could help douse those flames. But their new fire suppressant, developed here and patented in Canada and the United States, needs to pass stringent U.S. regulatory hurdles before it can be dropped from planes or helicopters over wildfires in Australia, California or even here at home. Their Napanee, Ont., startup, FireRein, convinced friends and family to invest in their product, called Eco-Gel, then convinced volunteer fire departments in the area to test their concoction. The company claims Eco-Gel snuffs out flames more effectively and using less water than standard suppressants, and doesn't contain the same toxic cocktail currently used to fight wildfires in Canada and around the world. ""We wanted to make a product that was safe — safe enough to eat,"" said Hodgen, FireRein's co-founder and vice-president. The purely plant-based product is made largely of canola oil, cornstarch and other ingredients commonly found in your kitchen pantry. It resembles a thick salad dressing or creamy honey, and is diluted with water to put out fires. Before FireRein, Hodgen worked as an industrial paramedic in the oil patch and battled wildfires in Manitoba, jobs that put him in regular contact with fire suppressing products packed with chemicals. ""I had no idea. We didn't wear gloves around those products,"" he recalled. ""We were told it was safe."" Before Eco-Gel can be used to fight wildfires anywhere, it needs certification from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), considered the industry gold standard. In Canada, every province requires that a fire suppressant be on the USDA's list of qualified products before it's dropped from aircraft. Municipal fire departments don't have the same requirement. ""It does seem a little strange we have to go to the United States to certify our product to have it dropped on Canadian soil,"" Hodgen noted. ""But you do need to have products that are plug-and-play with international jurisdictions."" FireRein is now working with Underwriters Laboratory and the USDA to get the designation it needs to drop Eco-Gel  from aircraft as well as for use at airports. That lengthy process could cost between $500,000 and $1 million. FireRein is hoping sales of its fire prevention spray gels, along with extra help from investors, will help see the company through the U.S. certification ordeal, Hodgen said. There are ongoing legal cases in Canada, the U.S. and Australia over soil and water contamination stemming from the use of fire-suppressing foam near military bases, airports and testing facilities. Near Smiths Falls, Ont., some residents are still dealing with the toxic aftermath of a 2017 flea market fire after firefighters battling the blaze used chemical-based foam. Fire chiefs involved in the incident later said they'd been told the suppressant they'd sprayed on the flames was ""environmentally friendly"" and ""biodegradable."" Emmons, a volunteer firefighter for more than 20 years, said he began researching better solutions because he didn't believe those claims. ""'Biodegradable' is a common green-washing term,"" Emmons said. The chief of the Drummond/North Elmsley fire service, which battled the 2017 flea market blaze, said his department is now using Eco-Gel in training, and plans to deploy it on future calls due to ""foam issues in the past.""   University of Guelph scientists have tested the environmental toxicity of several fire-suppressing products on the market. ""Eco-Gel actually turned out to be, in most cases, the least toxic of the six we tested,"" said Ryan Prosser, assistant professor of environmental sciences at the University of Guelph, who received a grant to carry out the research.  USDA certification requires a standardized test using rainbow trout, according to Prosser. Eco-Gel passed the trout test ""even at the highest rate of application,"" he said. ""We didn't observe mortality."" Another study by the Applied Science department at St. Lawrence College in Kingston, Ont., looked at how well three different products put out fires.   In the controlled evaluation, the researchers determined FireRein's Eco-Gel showed ""comparable, if not better knockdown time and water saving performance than similar, commercially available gel or foam agents used by firefighting agencies.""  Jeff Thompson, chief of the Stone Mills volunteer fire department northwest of Kingston, said his crew has used Eco-Gel at three big fires.  ""It's worked very well. We're a lot quicker,"" Thompson said. ""We had a tractor-trailer fire with new cars on it. They were able to stop that from spreading down the trailer into the newer cars.""   But Thompson said the primary reason his department decided to try it is to prevent the contamination of wells, lakes and rivers in their rural territory.  The FireRein team is now talking to the province of Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources regarding a pilot project during the next wildfire season. It's also reaching out to potential partners in Australia in the hopes of licensing and manufacturing their product in that country. ""I can have a bigger impact on the fire service doing this than actually being on the fire truck,"" said Hodgen, who's still a volunteer firefighter in his community.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/fire-fighters-develop-new-non-toxic-gel-fight-fires-need-us-approval-1.5428061,[],[]

Prosecutors had a 30-day window to appeal the ruling and Monday was the last day for the Crown to challenge the court's decision. ""I can confirm that the Crown has not filed an appeal in this matter,"" Brian Gray, a spokesman for Ontario's attorney general, said in an email to CBC News Monday.  On Dec. 19, Doody ruled there was not proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, to convict Boyle of the 19 charges against him. The charges included assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement. All but two charges involved Boyle's estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman. During his three hour ruling, Doody said he found Coleman's evidence unreliable due to inconsistencies in her testimony and memory lapses. Coleman testified that she was slapped, confined, tied up and forced to have sex with Boyle after the couple returned to Ottawa having spent five years in captivity in Afghanistan.  Boyle, 36, pleaded not guilty to all 19 charges and took the stand in his defence during the trial. Boyle said he was the victim, and his wife was emotionally and physically abusive to him. But Doody said he also found Boyle unreliable.  ""I do not believe her, just as I do not believe Mr. Boyle,"" he said. In October 2012, a Taliban-linked group kidnapped Boyle and Coleman near Kabul during a backpacking trip through Central Asia. Three of the couple's four children were born in captivity.  The trial became a test case for Canada's rape shield laws which prevent the defence from using emails, medical records or an alleged victim's past sexual history to prove a pattern of sexual behaviour. The court can make an exception if the accused, or their lawyers, demonstrate that including those details are of value. In this case, Doody ruled that the defence could introduce evidence that was in the possession of the accused: a medical record from a January 2018 session Coleman had with a psychologist. The psychologist's notes indicate Coleman said her husband began assaulting her in December, 2017. Coleman told police and the court that the physical and sexual assault began in October, 2017. The judge also allowed evidence about Coleman's sexual history after a section 276.2 application. The defence was able to ask Coleman about the couple's prior sexual activity, including consensual anal and vaginal intercourse, sexual acts involving ropes and consensual biting acts. Coleman previously testified that Boyle forced her to perform these acts against her will.   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/prosecutors-will-not-appeal-boyle-ruling-1.5430767,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/joshua-boyle-caitlan-coleman-verdict-1.5400633 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/joshua-boyle-trial-closing-arguments-1.5304787,/news/politics/joshua-boyle-caitlan-coleman-verdict-1.5400633 /news/canada/ottawa/joshua-boyle-trial-closing-arguments-1.5304787 /news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-crown-closing-joshua-boyle-trial-1.5307896 /news/canada/coleman-boyle-verdict-fifth-estate-1.5354155
251,Stephanie Hogan,2020-01-20T23:42:38.031Z,Just the basics: The new coronavirus outbreak  ,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus identified in China constitutes an international health emergency.  On Monday, China confirmed there has been human-to-human transmission of the virus. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members. Some medical staff have also been infected, but no number was confirmed.  The official Chinese Xinhua news agency reported that, as of Jan. 20, a total of 224 cases of the new coronavirus infection were reported in China, including 217 confirmed cases. The number of people who have died rose to four on Tuesday, health authorities in Shanghai said.  There have also been cases reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, all connected to people who had travelled from China. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases — such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). SARS was the coronavirus that originated in China in late 2002, and which eventually killed 44 people in Canada and infected more than 400 before the outbreak in China was declared by the WHO to be ""under control"" on Apr. 28, 2004.  The WHO's China office was first informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on Dec.31, 2019. The cases were all detected in Wuhan City. A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the probable cause by Chinese authorities Jan. 7. The WHO reported the evidence was ""highly suggestive"" that the source was a seafood market that also sells live poultry and meat from exotic animals in Wuhan.  Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they pass from animals to humans. But some, like this newly identified strain, can pass directly between humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., coronaviruses are most commonly spread by coughing or sneezing; close personal contact, such as shaking hands; or touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.  The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.  According to the WHO, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) deems the risk to Canadians visiting Wuhan as low. But it has updated its travel advisory, urging Canadians to take precautions, such as avoiding large crowds and high-risk areas such as farms and slaughterhouses, and avoiding contact with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of a coronavirus, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing.  There have been no confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in Canada, according to Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam. She says three people in Canada who had travelled to Wuhan were investigated for the virus, but results were negative.  PHAC says it will introduce measures in the coming week, including signs at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, advising travellers from affected areas of the world to inform border services staff of any flu-like symptoms.  The United States has begun screening people coming on direct flights from Wuhan for the newly identified coronavirus at New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person-to-person transmission.  - Dr. Jeremy Farrar, infectious disease specialist. We don't know enough to know whether we should be worried … If this is a virus that can sustain itself in humans now — is transmitted from person to person and lives in humans — then the Lunar New Year travel will spread it faster in China, no doubt. If this is a virus that is not sustainable in human populations, if it doesn't transmit well enough, then the Lunar New Year means we'll see new cases, it will create a lot of concern, but it won't cause problems.  - Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto The one piece of good news we have here is that this is possibly not as virulent a virus as SARS and won't result in as many deaths, but almost all the other news we have at the moment is unfortunately bad news … Fourteen medical staff infected from the first 200 cases is quite a high number. But on the other hand, the medical staff are in very close contact with the patients there, they're in the hospital wards and so on. And therefore, they're they're at greater risk than the general public.  - Dr. Derek Gatherer, Lancaster University WATCH: Dr. Allison McGeer of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital speaks to CBC News about the new coronavirus outbreak.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/coronavirus-1.5427310 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898,[]

Rural Municipalities Alberta said Monday that a survey of its members shows that they are owed a total of $173 million — a 114 per cent increase since a similar survey was done last spring. ""Municipalities require property taxes to provide the infrastructure and services that industry relies on to access natural resources,"" association president Al Kemmere said in a release. ""If Alberta's property tax system is not amended to prevent oil and gas companies from refusing to pay property taxes, many rural municipalities will struggle to remain viable."" In Ponoka County, south of Edmonton, Reeve Paul McLauchlin estimates his municipality is owed about $2.6 million out of a total municipal budget of $27 million. Ponoka now has a ""write-down budget"" — a budget for money owed by failed companies unlikely to ever be paid. The county never had such a budget until recently, McLauchlin said. ""It creates operational constraints, our ability to provide community services. We have non-profits asking for assistance. We say 'no' more and more."" Industry says the way taxes are assessed is driving companies out of business. Properties are assessed by the provincial government, which evaluates them on replacement cost and not on market value, said Ben Brunnen, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""We defend the need for the province to take a look at how assessment works and have it reflective of the market,"" he said. ""A lot of these unpaid taxes are coming in jurisdictions where you've got assets that are older and not as productive or economic. The choice for these types of assets is to shut (them) in or find a way to reduce costs."" Those shut-in wells often end up abandoned and unreclaimed after a bankruptcy, said Brunnen, who suggested some municipalities are going to have to accept less oil and gas revenue. The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled last year that municipalities are unsecured creditors, which puts them at the back of the line for tax debt collection after a bankruptcy. The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled last year that municipalities are unsecured creditors in the case of a bankruptcy, which puts them at the back of the line for tax debt collection on infrastructure such as pipelines. ""Oilpatch property taxes are now voluntary,"" suggested Regan Boychuk, a researcher with the Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project, which works to understand the impact of old energy infrastructure. Some of the unpaid taxes are assessed to companies that remain in operation. McLauchlin, an oilpatch consultant, said about 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from severely distressed companies in an industry hard and widely hit by lower resource prices. The rest of the shortfall is from companies that continue to operate but don't pay. ""My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,"" McLauchlin said. ""They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs."" Some of that has already occurred. Last year, Alberta's United Conservative government implemented legislation allowing municipalities to cut taxes on certain kinds of wells by up to about one-third. The province initially reimbursed municipalities for the cuts.  But the municipalities say that program has ended and they've been left to absorb the loss. Boychuk said mill rates on wells and other facilities haven't changed in years. Oil and gas reserves, however, have declined. ""What industry is really saying is that they've depleted their wells so far they can't cover operating costs. The wells are done and whatever wealth remains needs to be directed to cleanup rather than looted any further before bankruptcy."" The number of wells under care of the Orphan Well Association, an industry-funded group that cleans up abandoned wells, stands at 3,400 — an increase of 300 since last January. McLauchlin said industry is important to his county and council is happy to try to work out payment plans. Honouring those debts is one of the two things in life that is supposed to be unavoidable, he said. ""You've got to pay your taxes."" Alberta Municipal Affairs Minister Kaycee Madu said in a statement to CBC News that his government recognizes the impact this issue is having on rural communities. ""We are working to identify potential tools that may help balance the interests of municipalities with the economic realities facing many employers since the 2014-15 downturn,"" he said. ""A conversation is underway within government on strategies to address this situation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,[],https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary /news/canada/calgary/major-canadian-pot-companies-facing-proposed-class-action-lawsuits-in-the-u-s-1.5431520 /news/canada/calgary/supervised-consumption-site-review-alberta-1.5432665 /news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-alberta-government-panels-graham-thomson-1.5431182
255,David Morley,2019-12-30T09:00:00.675Z,Millions of children in need of humanitarian assistance heading into new year,"This column is an opinion by David Morley, president and CEO of UNICEF Canada. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. We are entering the final year of what has been one of the worst decades for children. War, disease and extreme weather events are robbing them of their right to simply be a kid – to have a safe, healthy and carefree childhood. In far too many communities around the world, sounds of youngsters laughing and getting into mischief are being replaced by silence. It doesn't have to be that way. This month, UNICEF launched Humanitarian Action for Children 2020, a report on the world's emergencies. It highlights some of the key challenges children are facing around the world: severe malnutrition, conflict, infectious disease, climate change, and access to education. Children displaced by crises are also vulnerable to increased harm, including gender-based violence, recruitment as soldiers, exploitation, and trafficking. The sheer magnitude of the situation is heartbreaking. The report identifies 59 million children in 64 countries who are living in crisis zones and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 2 million children with disabilities. These are the highest levels since we began keeping records. The projections for the year ahead are just as dire. The main causes are threefold – conflict, climate change and major outbreaks of disease. The number of armed conflicts is at a three-decade high, with many civil wars engulfing entire countries. More than 30 million children are caught in the middle. Yemen has been a battleground for more than four years. Fighting has been going on for six years in both the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Syria's civil war is now in its ninth year. And these conflicts have no end in sight. Some have lasted so long that many kids are growing up only knowing war. Top priorities in these war-torn regions include providing children with protection, safe water and sanitation, health care and nutrition. And the need is great. In the coming year, for example, UNICEF expects it will need to treat 5.1 million children for acute malnutrition, provide 4.5 million children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support, and distribute emergency cash assistance to 1.7 million families to meet their most urgent needs. Immediate responses to crises in the year ahead must also be balanced with the longer-term needs of children, most importantly their education, which is also under attack. During disasters, schools are often used as shelters or distribution centres, since they are usually among the strongest structures. In conflict zones, they are increasingly becoming targets. More than 3,000 schools have been closed in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the past three years because of violence and insecurity. Kids are incredibly adaptable, but in any emergency, getting them back into a classroom as quickly as possible is essential. Education to help them reach their potential is obviously important, but letting them be with their friends in a safe space also gives them a return to normalcy. As if wars and conflict weren't enough, millions of children are also threatened by outbreaks of highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Major outbreaks are now hitting the most vulnerable in conflict zones, greatly complicating the ability of aid agencies to respond. The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest ever recorded and the first to occur in the middle of a conflict zone. There are 3,000 confirmed cases, including more than 900 children. Measles has also become a threat to children despite safe and affordable vaccines. As with any public health campaign for children, educating the adult decision-makers is the key to eliminating this deadly threat. Climate change is also affecting the most vulnerable. More than 500 million children live in areas that have experienced extreme flooding, while 160 million live in regions that are subject to severe drought. And the number of extreme weather events keeps rising. Mozambique was hit by back-to-back cyclones earlier this year, for example, and rebuilding will take years. Regions like the Sahel in Africa, where livelihoods rely on agriculture, grazing and fishing, are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. Solutions demand a long-term commitment. The positive news is that humanitarian organizations have made tremendous progress working with host governments in areas likely to experience extreme weather and flooding, helping to build more resilient communities and better prepare for disasters. Still, the threats children are facing are overwhelming. The amount of funding for emergencies that UNICEF projects it will need in 2020 is $4.2 billion US, a staggering 3.5 times the amount required in 2010, underscoring how frightening the world has become for young people. But as someone who has worked in the international humanitarian sector for going on four decades, I refuse to be discouraged. We cannot give up. The international community, governments and civil society need to come together to protect and defend children's rights. The government of Canada is playing a global leadership role in prioritizing education for children in conflict zones and other protracted humanitarian crises. But as a nation we must do more to help children around the world. People in this country clearly care about children's welfare. I am confident Canadians will rise to the challenge and defend, for every child everywhere, the right to a safe and healthy childhood.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-child-welfare-1.5367654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-war-saudis-houthis-1.5373868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unhcr-refugee-forum-1.5398929 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mali-violence-massacre-children-1.5171664 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/mali-mission-1.5272076 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/violence-against-health-workers-worsening-measles-outbreak-in-congo-1.5377716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-who-cdc-1.5385508 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/zimbabwe-wfp-food-aid-1.5382107,/news/health/measles-who-cdc-1.5385508 /news/world/zimbabwe-wfp-food-aid-1.5382107
256,Andie Bulman,2020-01-18T10:30:00.000Z,Winter got you down? Comfort food is a great solution ,"January is always a rough month. Without fail, I overspend, overeat and drink way too much wine in December. Inspired by the new year, I fall into the same trap every year: I buy kale, join a gym, sign up for Dry January. By week two, my lust for wellness has faded, and I grumpily attend the gym while dreaming of the breweries I plan to visit in the coming months. By week three, I've endured three snowstorms, two credit card bills and one round of influenza. Next comes Blue Monday. The third Monday of January is considered to be the saddest day of the year. It makes perfect sense to me. Afterall, the dark closes in around five and it's a long way until the green grass of spring. And then there's the snow. All the snow. That's the way it's felt, including this latest blizzard that has struck much of Newfoundland. Now's a good time to embrace hibernation, take a break from the resolutions and … make some comfort food! For me, comfort food is connected to memory and place. Food that makes you feel cozy. My favourite is a grilled cheese. It reminds me of my mom. I remember sitting through math class in Grade 4. It was winter. I had failed a test (division was tough). I was near tears and just wanted my mom. I got off the bus, went upstairs, and was greeted with a hug and a grilled cheese. The whole day was turned around. Comfort food is a concept that exists across cultures. Different vegetation, climates and traditions lend themselves to different types of comfort food, but a particular idea — that certain foods make you a bit nostalgic, warm, and safe — exists everywhere. I was curious about comfort food in different cultures, so I reached out to some neighbours and friends for recipes. Malin Enstrom tends to make Swedish food and baked goods during Scandinavian holidays, but she'll also whip up treats when she's missing home or feeling disconnected from her own culture. Like here, the idea of comfort food in Sweden is connected to nostalgia and familiarity, but Malin also suggests that comfort food is connected to scent. ""We (Swedes) love cooking and baking with fragrant spices such as nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, star anise, cinnamon, juniper and saffron. The spices used tend to depend on the seasons and those are probably my winter-months spices,"" she told me. ""In the summer months I tend to cook with lighter flavours, such as elderflower, dill, chive, fennel seeds and parsley."" The food she misses most as an adult includes caviar, pickled herring in dill mustard sauce and Swedish meatballs. ""This sounds like a cliché, but Swedish meatballs are fantastic. When you combine the meatballs with garlic-mashed potatoes, partridgeberry sauce, pickled cucumbers and a cream sauce, you get the perfect combination of warmness, tartness and a hint of sweetness,"" she said. ""It is a simple dish to make and I make it fairly often. It probably has a heightened effect here as I have to make it from scratch as I want the spices to be just right. "" I asked Malin for her favourite recipe and boy, did she deliver. Literally, she brought a jar of juniper apple soup to my house for me to sample. The flavour was tart, piney, and smooth. She recommended serving it alongside some braised moose for a Swedish/ Newfoundland fusion dish. I've shared Malin's recipe below. Hailing from Brazil, Fernanda Cedraz Mamede is my favourite baker in town. She makes towering gooey chocolate cakes at the Georgestown Bakery. I'm obsessed with them and I order a piece most Saturdays. Fernanda highlighted that Brazil is an enormous country with an incredibly diverse population. ""In Minas Gerais comfort food would be cheese bread (Pão de queijo),"" she told me. ""In Bahia, comfort food can be a seafood stew with coconut milk, palm oil and cilantro (Moqueca). In Rio Grande do Sul, polenta would be called comfort food. In Amazonas comfort food would be a stew made with some plants found in the Amazon Rainforest (Tacacá)."" When pressed, Fernanda mentioned that rice and beans would probably be something that the whole country would classify as comfort food. ""When a Brazilian thinks about that combination of food, we immediately think about eating this at home with family."" Fernanda is from the northeast of Brazil and her ideal comfort food is 'cuscus.' It's a breakfast food made of butter, cheese, eggs, and occasionally sweet coconut milk. It requires a type of corn flour that is impossible to find in St. John's, so she adapted the recipe below for us. Prajwala Dixit is one of my favourite writers in town and I suspected that she's also a great cook. Like Brazil, India is an enormous and diverse country, so identifying one specific comfort food was a challenge. For Prajwala, a spicy tomato lentil soul eaten with a dollop of ghee is a staple, but there are other dishes she craves. ""Weeks where I have had long days, I crave my mother's anna saaru. The tangy flavours of the saaru intertwine with the earthiness of rice,"" she told me. ""The smell of fresh seasoning of hing (asafoetida) and black mustard coupled with coriander makes the mouth water and the heart melt."" Prajwala's comforting spice mixture is a top secret family recipe, so our third recipe is my own blueberry grilled cheese recipe. Juniper apple soup from Sweden (serves 6-8) Ingredients 1 tbsp juniper berries 2 cardamom pods 2 allspice berries 1 cinnamon stick 2 sprigs fresh tarragon 2 tbsp olive oil 2 apples, peeled, cored and diced 1 shallot, finely chopped 1 3-inch piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped 4 cups chicken stock 2 cups heavy cream Juice from 2 apples or 1 cup apple cider ¼ cup cider vinegar ¼ cup apple brandy ¼ cup port or Madeira Salt and pepper Directions: 1. Wrap the juniper berries, cardamom pods, allspice berries, cinnamon stick and tarragon in a piece of cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine. 2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the apples, shallot and ginger and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until the shallots starts to soften. Add the stock, cream, apple juice or cider, stir, then add the spice bundle and bring to a brisk simmer. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, 30-40 minutes. 3. Remove the cheesecloth bundle and blend the soup with a blender, in batches, and purée. Return the soup to the saucepan. Bring the soup to a boil, stir in the brandy, vinegar and port or Madeira, and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat. Cuscus from Brazil Ingredients 2 cups cornmeal 1 1/2 cups white sugar 1 cup milk 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 eggs 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1 tsp baking powder Directions: Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (170 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch round cake pan. Blend cornmeal, sugar, milk, coconut milk, flour, eggs, and vegetable oil in a blender until smooth; add baking powder and blend to integrate. Pour the cornmeal mixture into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean (30 to 40 minutes). Andie's gussied-up blueberry grilled cheese *Makes one sandwich A grilled cheese is a simple thing, but that means that the quality of ingredients really counts. Always real butter! I saw a friend make a grilled cheese using canola oil once and it shook me to my core. Buy the crusty sourdough! Good bread counts here. Don't skimp on the cheese either. You want an applewood smoked cheddar, shredded Gruyere, good quality cheeses that melt nicely. A little touch of mozza in there is always a good idea. Ingredients 2 tbsp butter, softened, divided 2 slices sourdough, cut on the diagonal 1/3 cup shredded applewood smoked cheddar 1/4 cup Gruyere Small handful of mozzarella, shredded  1 tbsp of quick blueberry jam Directions: Spread a tablespoon of softened butter onto one side of each slice of bread. Do the same with the blueberry jam. Next you're going to build your sandwich. So throw all of that shredded cheese on top. Shredding the cheese is key, otherwise it'll melt at different rates. Heat a skillet over medium heat. I think using a well-seasoned cast iron is important. Next, melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan. Place one of your sandwiches onto the heated surface. Cook two minutes on each side, or until golden brown and the cheese is melted. Simple and delicious.

257,Rosa Marchitelli,2020-01-20T02:26:20.853Z,Caught on camera: Man chases dangerous driver after 911 puts him on hold ,"Sam Gill says he had a knot in his stomach as he watched a driver in front of him barrelling down a busy road in Mississauga, Ont., weaving in and out of oncoming traffic, jumping a curb and hitting a snowbank so hard the impact knocked his headlight off, though that didn't stop him. When Gill dialled 911 for help, he was put on hold.  Just before 8 p.m. on a Sunday last month, Gill spotted the other motorist ""driving erratically — can't stay in his lanes, can't maintain control of the vehicle.""  ""Every second that passed, I'm thinking, 'Oh my god, somebody is going to die,"" he said.  Canadians make an estimated nine million calls to 911 every year, taking for granted that someone will answer, says Holly Barkwell, the Canadian region director of the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), an international organization that works to improve 911 service. ""Unfortunately, that is not the case everywhere across Canada,"" she says. In reality, Barkwell says, the 911 system might not work as expected because it's fragmented, underfunded and operating on technology that's over 50 years old. ""It's been ignored too long. It's an issue of public safety.""  There are no mandatory standards in Canada, but voluntary standards set by NENA in 2006 say 90 per cent of 911 calls should be answered within 10 seconds, and 95 per cent within 20 seconds. But because there is no national oversight on 911 service, there's no way to tell how Canada measures up.  In Gill's case, he was on hold for almost six minutes (his phone was hands-free) while he chased the dangerous driver — honking and flashing his lights, trying to warn others to steer clear. ""At this point I'm saying to myself … if [911] doesn't answer, should I push him off the road? I might hurt him in the process, but I might save his life and potentially the lives of others,"" he said. Peel Regional Police, which runs the 911 service in Gill's area, says it was swamped with double the usual number of calls at the time, adding it had a ""record number"" of calls in 2019, though an exact number wasn't available.  By the time an operator answered and police arrived, the driver had crashed into another snowbank and passed out behind the wheel, with his vehicle still in drive, Gill said. He says an officer told him the man was drunk. Peel Regional Police wouldn't confirm that with Go Public.  Similarly, Helena Shepherd-Snider couldn't reach 911 when her husband had a heart attack in 2016. Instead, she got a recorded message saying the number was not in service, and to dial zero for the operator. Initially, she says the operator refused to call for her, telling Shepherd-Snider she should do it herself. ""It felt like a double whammy. [I was thinking] where else can I go? What can I do? Time was of the essence,"" she said. After about 15 minutes, she convinced the operator to call 911. She credits fast-working paramedics for saving her husband's life. When the dust settled, Shepherd-Snider discovered everyone on her block — about half a kilometre outside Sudbury, Ont. — had 911 service except the last four houses including hers.  Depending on where you live, 911 is run by municipalities, the police or the province, while telecom companies are responsible for supplying the network needed to connect the calls — an example of how the system is fragmented, according to Barkwell.  When Shepherd-Snider called Bell and the municipality, she says they ""passed the buck"" — neither correcting the issue. Instead, Bell cut off 911 service to her neighbours. ] The company tells Go Public that their block is outside Sudbury's service boundaries and that Shepherd-Snider's neighbours ""had been erroneously provided with 911."" The city says those houses are a provincial responsibility and have separate emergency numbers for ambulance, fire and police. Shepherd-Snider had no idea.  The shortcomings of the 911 system were flagged back in a 2013 CRTC report and, says Barkwell, haven't changed. The report found: One of the biggest problems, according to Barkwell, is that 911 services still use old analog technology, which makes it difficult to locate people using mobile phones. She says mobile apps have a better chance of locating someone than 911. ""The biggest question I get from people often is how come Uber can find me and how come Domino's Pizza can find me but 911 can't find me?"" Barkwell said. A number of recent deaths have highlighted other problems with 911 services, and how they co-ordinate with emergency personnel.  B.C. is promising changes to its 911 system after a woman bled to death after waiting 35 minutes for an ambulance in Vancouver in 2018. An ambulance was dispatched promptly, but attendants were unable to reach her because the doors and an elevator in her building were locked, and firefighters were called in too late.  In Ontario, the deaths of four people in two separate incidents led to dozens of recommendations from the provincial coroner, and to a bill meant to address problems with 911.  ""People have lost their lives and people will continue to lose their lives,"" said France Gélinas, the NDP MPP, who last year put forward Bill 75, which is currently before the social policy committee.  Gélinas says she doesn't believe the Tory government will pass the bill, however, and, when asked by Go Public, the provincial Ministry of Health wouldn't say. Spokesperson David Jensen said the government has established a task force to look at the problems with the system, including the coroner's recommendations. Ontario does not have legislation to govern delivery of 911 service or to provide secure funding for it. Certain provinces, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec do. In March, the CRTC introduced a plan to modernize 911 networks in Canada. As part of that plan, telecoms must upgrade from analog technology to digital by June 30, 2023.  It's a good start, says Barkwell, but doesn't address the many other problems like inconsistent or inadequate funding.  In the meantime, after his experience with the dangerous driver in Mississauga, Sam Gill says he worries what might happen to his family or others if there is another emergency. ""We've lost our faith and that's not a good feeling,"" he said. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

258, KRISTA BRODA,2020-01-20T12:48:49.717Z,"After 10 years in Regina, I've realized there's nowhere else I'd rather be","I recently marked a decade since I became an honourary Saskatchewanian. My younger self would never have believed it. I was lucky enough to be raised on Vancouver Island. I had never owned a winter jacket or heard of a block heater and I could go an entire summer without a mosquito bite. There was no greater thrill than waking up to hear school was cancelled because there was snow in the forecast. It was paradise.  Having family from coast to coast allowed me to travel throughout Canada. I was always proud that I had been to ""every province in Canada, except Saskatchewan."" People understood. I had seen all of the provinces that needed to be seen. As anybody not from Saskatchewan would tell you, I wasn't missing much.  In August 2009, I happened to be in Calgary for a football game when the Riders came to town. At this point, I only knew of one person from Saskatchewan I had met in my entire life. They were like mythical creatures to me. Every once in a while there was a wholesome story in the news, or some obscure town was named the Coldest Place on Earth for a day, but Saskatchewanians were rarely seen out of their natural habitat.  That August long weekend, Rider fans descended on McMahon Stadium by the thousands. They were loud, they were green, and they made sure that everybody knew exactly where they came from. I had never seen anything like it.  Sitting next to me in Section X was a charming guy that had just driven in from Regina. Between his chirps at Henry Burris, he proudly told me he grew up in the village of Grayson, population 167. His dad was a farmer and his hometown was having a fundraiser soon to raise money for a new curling rink. He was every cliché I had ever known about the province. I was in love with him by half time.  My first trip to Saskatchewan came a month later for the Labour Day Classic. My expectations were very low.  My new love had made a bold claim that Regina's Italian Star Deli has the best sandwiches in the world. If nothing else, I'd at least get a half-decent meal.  He also told me that Taylor Field was fun and the pink lemonades were second to none, but it was really old, very cramped and the bathrooms didn't have hot water. He severely downplayed the magic that happened inside those crumbling walls.  My first time at the old stadium would easily make the top five best days of my life. I had never experienced an atmosphere so electric and so fun. I met dozens of people that day, each one more friendly and welcoming than the last.  I remember thinking to myself several times throughout the game that people are really lucky to live here but, oddly enough, everybody seemed to already know that. They truly believed that they lived in one of the best places in Canada. After that weekend, I was starting to believe it too.  After a few more trips to Regina — and more Italian Star Deli sandwiches than I'd like to admit — I started to pick up on the quirks that maybe only an outsider could see.  The language they spoke was different than other provinces. I had a lot of questions about grid roads and sloughs and RMs (rural municipalities), and why everyone gave me a two-finger wave over their steering wheel as soon as I left a paved road.  When winter arrived, I remember asking why perfectly good extension cords were littering the parking lots. I soon learned those were just Saskatchewan snow snakes.  The people of Saskatchewan are as unique as the sunsets. I couldn't get enough. I had fallen in love with the province and the province loved me back. It felt like home.  On Nov. 30, 2009 – the day after the heartbreaking Grey Cup loss – I made the biggest and greatest decision of my life. I moved to Regina.  I went on to marry that charming small town boy from Section X of McMahon Stadium. We raise our boys here, and they love where they live as much as we do. Those over-the-top-friendly people that I met that day at Taylor Field went on to become some of my best friends.  I feel lucky to have had a front row seat to watch Regina blossom into a vibrant city full of creative entrepreneurs, world-class local shops and restaurants, and a craft beer scene that could rival anywhere in North America.  So, Saskatchewan, please consider this my thank you for welcoming me with open arms and showing me – quite literally –  how to speak your language.  There's nowhere else I'd rather be.

259,Anonymous,2020-01-18T12:00:00.698Z,Fredericton centre to offer warm place to go when homeless shelters are closed ,"A new warming centre in Fredericton is hoping to provide the city's homeless population with a place to get out of the cold when other options are not available. The centre will be open starting Monday in Barnabas Centre, next to the Brunswick Street Baptist Church. Sara Davidson, a member of the centre's planning committee, said the centre is by no means a permanent solution and that more housing is needed.  But she said it is an important stopgap for the city's most vulnerable. ""We thought, this is something that is achievable right now,"" said Davidson. The shelter will be open seven days a week from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. This is a time period when there are fewer options available for homeless people. The men's, women's and out-of-the-cold shelters are closed then, along with the community kitchen. Davidson said homeless people will often go to other public places, which may not be as accommodating. But even places that are welcoming, like the waiting room at the downtown clinic, are not the most exciting places to spend a few hours. ""I can see how bored people are getting,"" said Davidson, who is a doctor at the clinic. ""If we can provide somewhere where people can go, and they can actually be engaged … we could help people feel like they actually belong somewhere."" Donald McLoud is one of the people planning on using the centre. He's been homeless on and off for three years and has been living at the tent city behind the Victoria Health Centre since April of last year. He said he often goes to the library to draw when the shelters close, and that has been great, but it's always good to have another option.

260,Anonymous,2020-01-18T09:00:00.999Z,"Eight years after, Canada's move to close Iranian embassy still controversial","The final act of foreign officer Barbara Martin's career was to oversee the closure of the Canadian embassy in Tehran in 2012 — a decision that continues to divide members of this country's Iranian community. Martin was the Department of Foreign Affairs' director general for the Middle East and North Africa when then-minister John Baird announced Canada had suspended diplomatic relations with Iran and expelled Iranian diplomats from Canada. The move came months after Iranian students stormed the British embassy in the Iranian capital in November 2011 — an event which sent a chill through the diplomatic community. ""Watching an event like that happen to a very friendly allied country, we were concerned about the security at our own embassy and whether we could see ourselves facing some sort of similar event,"" Martin said Thursday in an interview with The House. Before closing the embassy, she said, officials destroyed all records and computer equipment to ensure none of it fell into Iranian hands. One of the last tasks performed by embassy staff before they discreetly caught flights back to Canada was to take down the Canadian flag, she said. Now, almost eight years later — and in the immediarte aftermath of last week's downing of UIA Flight PS752, which killed all 176 passengers and crew on board, including 57 Canadians — some Iranian Canadians would like to see the federal government restore diplomatic ties with Iran and reopen the embassy. ""As Justin Trudeau says, Canada needs to mediate and de-escalate the situation,"" Iranian Canadian Congress spokesperson Pouyan Tabasinejad told The House on Friday. ""We've seen what happens when we don't have anything, we've seen what the politics of isolation and conflict give us. For eight years, we've seen that since Stephen Harper closed the embassy."" But critics of the Iranian government such as lawyer and human rights activist Kaveh Shahrooz say re-opening the embassy would send Tehran the wrong message. ""I don't see this argument for diplomatic relations, which really should be thought of as a reward for good behaviour. I don't understand why this argument keeps coming up when the Iranian regime has just killed so many of our civilians,  lied about it and is trying to obfuscate and hide the truth,"" he told The House on Friday.  Having an embassy in Iran might have helped the federal government respond to the airline disaster, but it's not critical, Martin said. ""We would have been on the ground faster. We would have been able to get in to meet with officials within the (Iranian) Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate consideration for speedy issuance of visas. We would have been able to get information more quickly from both Iranians and our allies,"" said Martin, now an adjunct professor at the School of Policy Studies at Queen's University and a fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. ""That said, you can overcome those limitations and I think the government has been very effective in doing so.""",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-oman-meeting-1.5430504 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/flight-ps752-mansour-pourjam-1.5431001,/radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624/the-world-wanted-maduro-gone-so-why-is-he-still-calling-the-shots-in-venezuela-1.5431531 /radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624/legal-divide-lies-behind-wet-suwet-en-pipeline-protest-expert-says-1.5431526

A statement from a group, which did not identify itself, said the demonstration is in support of Wet'suwet'en members opposing the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern B.C. The terminal reopened as the protest ended around 9 a.m., and traffic started flowing again. BC Ferries said all sailings leaving Swartz Bay would be delayed until traffic on Highway 17 has cleared. BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said the protest blocked the inbound lanes to the Swartz Bay terminal, but there was also ""concern"" that kayaks might have been in the water. Passengers driving to get to the fare booths ahead of the sailings were stuck in gridlocked traffic. Sidney RCMP were also on scene. Anne Roberge had a reservation for the 7 a.m. sailing and couldn't get close to the terminal. ""At one point we said, 'Oh boy. That doesn't look good,'"" she said, speaking by phone from her spot in traffic. Coastal GasLink is building a 670-kilometre pipeline from northeast B.C. to Kitimat on the coast. The project runs through Wet'suwet'en traditional territory. The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along its path, but five hereditary chiefs say the project has no authority without their consent. Last week, RCMP blocked access to Wet'suwet'en territory, heightening tensions between government officials and hereditary chiefs. The Mounties have increased their presence in the area, setting up a checkpoint and restricting access along a service road that leads to three sites where the Wet'suwet'en are maintaining a presence.  Kolin Sutherland-Wilson, a spokesperson for the Swartz Bay demonstration, said the grassroots protest was comprised of young people, students and Indigenous allies from across the province. ""I hope it makes a statement because what's happening up north is disheartening ... our way of life is being criminalized by the province,"" said Sutherland-Wilson, a UVic student who is from the Gitxsan First Nation — a neighbouring nation and ally to the Wet'suwet'en Nation.

262,Anonymous,2020-01-21T00:20:22.347Z,"Young francophones trafficked outside Quebec more vulnerable to exploitation, says MNA","Given the frequent language barrier, young francophone Quebecers are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation when trafficked outside the province, the co-chair of a provincial commission examining the sexual exploitation of minors said Monday. Coalition Avenir Québec MNA Ian Lafrenière, a former Montreal police commander, said when police in other provinces break up sex-trafficking rings, they often find underage victims from Quebec. ""You take a kid from Montreal: she's 14; she's not speaking fluently English. You bring her to Calgary. Well, you know what? She's going to be more vulnerable. It's going to be hard for her to get help because of the language barrier,"" Lafrenière said at a news conference in the lead-up to the Montreal hearings.  The commission was launched last November in an attempt to get a handle on what police say is a growing problem in the province. A preliminary report released at the time said four out of ten Quebec victims of sexual exploitation are minors.  More than 300 establishments in Montreal and 630 across the province offer sexual services, the report said. But it also noted girls and young women from Quebec are frequently trafficked out of province, where they are less likely to speak the language of the majority, have a social network or know where to go for help.  Last October, police arrested 31 people as part of a sweeping investigation into an Ontario-based human trafficking and organized crime ring that operated around Canada. The majority of the women came from Quebec, police said at the time.  The commission held a first round of hearings in Quebec City in November. It will head to Val-d'Or, in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, later this week.  In Montreal, the commission will hear from local police and prevention workers, along with representatives from the hotel industry and the Grand Prix. Liberal MNA Christine St-Pierre, also a co-chair of the commission, said it's important to hear from a variety of perspectives. ""Montreal is very attractive for these events and also the hotels. It is very important to talk to them and to say to them that they have to be involved in this situation, and they have to be aware that they have to be partners,"" she said. The Longueuil police service (SPAL), which launched a team to support victims of sexual exploitation last year, recommended Monday that police keep better tabs on what's going on — reaching out to teachers or parents of teenagers even if a crime has yet to be committed. ""Sometimes it's not criminal, but we have something to do anyway, and we should do something,"" said SPAL spokesperson Ghyslain Vallieres. ""Also, we want police officers to be more human in the way they're seeing those victims."" He said Longueuil police are working with a Montreal group that's fighting sexual exploitation, the Concertation des luttes contre l'exploitation sexuelle (CLES), to ""open the eyes of the police officers on our territory"" so they can better understand what victims go through. Those victims are sometimes as young as 12, and they often don't see their abuser as a pimp, but as a lover,"" he said. They often don't want to press charges when the police intervene. SPAL's new team provides social and psychological support, rather than focusing immediately on criminality, he said. This approach has helped lead to convictions, even if the victim at first didn't want to press charges. ""We have to be creative. We have think outside of the box, and that's what we are doing at the SPAL,"" Vallieres said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-sexual-exploitation-commission-1.5433656,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-police-survivors-expand-indigenous-outreach-1.5392992,/news/canada/montreal/montreal-police-survivors-expand-indigenous-outreach-1.5392992 /news/canada/montreal/longueuil-john-school-initiative-1.5356333 /news/canada/montreal/man-who-lured-babysitters-on-facebook-gets-12-years-in-prison-for-assault-of-14-year-old-1.5384472 /news/canada/montreal/spvm-spal-assaults-francois-lamarre-1.5402225
263,Anonymous,2020-01-20T22:10:15.073Z,Police chief calls woman's arrest at a Halifax Walmart 'unfortunate',"Halifax's police chief says he's referred the ""disappointing"" case of a 23-year-old woman who was arrested while shopping at a Halifax Walmart last week to the province's police watchdog, which is now deciding whether it will launch an investigation. Santina Rao spoke publicly about her experiences to several media outlets last week and said she was approached by police officers while shopping with her two young children inside the Mumford Road store on Jan. 15. She said police believed she was concealing items and that when she became upset they cuffed her without explaining why she was being arrested. A video posted by the Halifax Examiner to YouTube shows part of the altercation, including Rao swearing at a police officer to get off of her before one officer physically brought her to the ground and they struggled. Two officers appeared to restrain Rao while there were staff members in the background. Calling it racial profiling, Rao wrote on Facebook that she had attempted to show her receipts and told police they could search her stroller. She said the encounter broke her wrist, gave her a concussion and left her with bruising around her eyes, arms and back. She also said she scratched one of the officers. Police charged her with causing a disturbance, assaulting a peace officer and resisting arrest. They sent out a release the following day stating a woman ""became verbally abusive and was behaving aggressively"" when they tried to arrest her. Rao is not facing any theft-related charges. Rao has no previous criminal record. CBC has contacted for Rao for comment, but hasn't heard back yet. ""Certainly anything like this happens, it's disappointing. We take all of these matters very seriously,"" said police Chief Dan Kinsella while speaking to reporters after a meeting of the board of police commissioners Monday afternoon. Pat Curran, the interim director of SIRT, said they're determining whether the incident fits within the agency's mandate. He said they haven't decided if there will be an investigation. Meanwhile, Kinsella said he's waiting until SIRT makes a decision to take any further action. He said the two officers involved are still working and continuing with their regular duties. He wouldn't comment on whether the officers responded appropriately after Walmart called asking for assistance with an alleged theft investigation. ""Whenever an incident like this occurs, it is unfortunate,"" he said. ""We need to wait, we need to respect the process, we need to make an informed decision based on the appropriate investigation."" A manager at the Mumford Road Walmart declined an interview and said he couldn't comment since it was a police investigation. He referred questions to the company's headquarters in Ontario. A statement from Felicia Feder, manager of Walmart Canada's corporate affairs, said all inquires would have to be directed to police. Earlier at the police commission meeting, activist El Jones, who also wrote about Rao's arrest for the Halifax Examiner, addressed the case during a presentation about the force's budget and said it reflects the police force's poor relationship with Halifax's black community. ""As a black woman, I cannot in good conscience stand before you without advocating for this poor black woman, who because she is poor, is racially profiled in a Walmart while we talk about giving [$700,000] more to the police force who beat her,"" she said. Jones said police asking for Rao's ID was effectively a street check even though it happened in a store. ""When she was questioned about her address, she asked the police why they needed this information. We are being told repeatedly we have the right to refuse a street check and if we are asked to show our information we can refuse, but we see here the consequence is what happened to Santina Rao,"" Jones said. Last October, Nova Scotia's justice minister announced he would permanently ban street checks after a legal opinion co-authored by a former top judge found the Halifax police practice, which disproportionately targeted black males, is illegal.

264,Sarah Rieger,2020-01-17T19:50:30.444Z,How Twitch viewers helped police narrow down location of possible child abuser in just hours,"""Oh my God, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen."" That was a video game streamer's first thought on Dec. 16, when he spotted a video on social media — the disturbing video that would lead the Canadian to spend the next 24 hours tracking down evidence and providing it to police. It resulted in a Calgary woman being charged for allegedly assaulting a child. CBC News has agreed not to name the sleuthing streamer, so his employment won't be affected. The video was originally posted to Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gamers. It shows a woman playing the game Fortnite as she repeatedly slaps and then bites a screaming toddler, seemingly frustrated with the child for distracting her from the game. The video then cuts to a few hours later, showing her roughly handling an infant before throwing the child onto the bed that she's sitting on while playing the game. The streamer said he immediately sent the video to a contact at Twitch and then he searched on the user's social media for her location — it turned out to be Calgary — before calling the local police. But he still felt like he hadn't done enough. So he decided to scour the site, downloading evidence just in case it vanished.  ""I would say probably within 60 minutes of my bringing it to the attention of Twitch staff, they had suspended this person's account,"" he said. He wasn't the only one dismayed by what he'd seen. CBC News was contacted by concerned gaming fans, as far away as the United Kingdom, who said they had reported the video to Crime Stoppers or police.  Police said that within two hours of first receiving tips about the video, officers were able to track the online gamer to a Calgary home, where officers found a woman, man and two children.   CBC News is not naming the woman or her account username to protect the identity of the children. The woman has been charged with one count of assault, and the children were taken away. Possibly more charges relating to other videos are on the way, police said. Staff Sgt. Peter Siegenthaler, with the Calgary Police Service's child abuse unit, said police rely on tips from the public in cases like this. ""It's hard, because sometimes [online] videos have been circulated for years, and it's hard to determine the origin and time these videos are produced."" As the sleuthing streamer dug through the videos to download evidence, he discovered a different user who had also posted hours of concerning videos with a child. The videos showed the person loudly berating the child while using expletives, at one point coughing into the child's eye and threatening to withhold medication if the child didn't stop interrupting her game. CBC News has seen those videos. As with the first user's video, some of the time-stamps were as recent as mid-December. The streamer reported those videos to police as well. That user has since deleted all of the videos from her channel. Police in the U.S. city where that user lives initially said they were not investigating but have since said they have reached out to the streamer who saw the videos for more information. The streamer who reported the videos to police said that while the internet can be a nasty place and vigilantism doesn't always pan out, he's extremely proud of how quickly the Twitch community rallied to help the children in the videos. ""People, in general, are a lot more inherently good than we tend to give them credit for.… I wouldn't have been able to live with myself had I simply let this go,"" he said.  Nicole Letourneau​​​, chair of parent-infant mental health at Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation, said everyone should take direction from how the online community quickly took action in response to the videos. ""I think members of the public are ethically obligated to protect children of parents who don't protect children.… It just needs to be reported,"" she said.  She said this situation holds lessons for parents, too. Letourneau studies how toxic stress can undermine the relationships between parents and children, and how different factors like mental illness or addiction can undermine a parent's ability to be attentive, responsive or nurturing to their child. ""A parent who is mentally well or doesn't have an addiction gets rewards from their children,"" Letourneau said.  But in a situation where a parent isn't well, she said, that reward system isn't functioning properly, and the child becomes an interference — blocking the parent from enjoying gambling, substances, video games or browsing social media on their cellphone.  ""The early years for children are fleeting … everything seems to be tied in to positive early nurturing environments,"" Letourneau said. ""If you're someone who's finding that your kids are annoying you and you're playing a game, it might be a red flag that things aren't quite as they should be.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-child-abuse-investigation-1.5410011,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-fortnite-video-1.5400324 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-fortnite-video-charges-1.5400971,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary /news/canada/calgary/edouard-maurice-landowner-trespasser-lawsuit-ryan-watson-alberta-1.5429322 /news/canada/calgary/third-electricity-emergency-alert-issued-this-week-in-alberta-1.5429299 /news/canada/calgary/coyotes-attack-dog-edgemont-calgary-1.5429124
265,Anonymous,2020-01-17T23:00:00.271Z,'Stop this investigation': Jean Charest's lawyer says former premier steered clear of corruption,"Jean Charest's lawyer says the former Liberal premier is innocent of any wrongdoing when it comes to political financing — and it is high time for Quebec's anti-corruption squad to end a six-year investigation that has not led to charges against Charest's friend, Marc Bibeau, or anyone else. Michel Massicotte told Radio-Canada that aside from the fact his client is a friend of Bibeau's — something Charest has never disavowed — nothing in newly released documents pertaining to that UPAC investigation call into question Charest's integrity. Massicotte's comments come a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a request for a publication ban filed by lawyers for Bibeau, a one-time top fundraiser for the Quebec Liberal Party. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision, a trove of information from the investigation, known as Operation Mâchurer, is now public. The documents include general warrants and witness statements, and they detail why, in 2016, UPAC wanted to conduct secret searches of the offices of companies owned by Bibeau. The revelations come just as Charest is mulling over making a bid to lead the Conservative Party of Canada, and the former premier wants to clear the air. ""We discussed it, and given what's been out there in the public sphere — not just yesterday, but for a very long time — it looked to us to be necessary to address this issue,"" Massicotte told Radio-Canada's Isabelle Richer in an interview Friday. Even though Charest was head of the Liberal party, he had nothing to do with Bibeau's fundraising practices, Massicotte said.  Massicotte said if some companies contributed illegally to election funds, Charest was not aware of it. ""To support a practice, you have to be aware that practice exists,"" said Massicotte. He said Charest knew Bibeau was involved in the PLQ's so-called ""sectoral funding""  — a term used to describe soliciting companies to ask staff to make political contributions. Massicotte conceded that it's been demonstrated companies did, in fact, contribute illegally to the Liberal Party's electoral coffers — but he maintained that had nothing to do with how sectoral funding actually worked. ""It wasn't up to the firm to give money, it was up to each person individually,"" he explained. ""There was no twisting of arms, either."" In any event, even if businesses did make illegal political contributions to the PLQ, ""Mr. Charest knew nothing about it,"" he said. Operation Mâchurer's goal was to establish a link between illegal political financing and the awarding of public contracts by Charest's Liberal government. ""We have always said, to whoever wanted to hear it, that we are innocent as far as any of this goes,"" Massicotte said. He pointed out that Charest has already explained all this, in great detail, in a 300-page declaration to lawyers for the Charbonneau commission, who interviewed him in 2014. The former premier also spoke to UPAC investigators on two separate occasions, before Operation Mâchurer was even launched, more than five years ago. Operation Mâchurer has found nothing new, he said. ""Stop this investigation,"" he said. ""Stop saying we are hiding something, or whatever. We have offered our full co-operation, but this co-operation does not seem to have been reciprocated."" Massicotte said he believes investigators leaked the now-public documents out of frustration, in an effort to create a ""trial by media"" scenario because there is no evidence of any crime.  However, opposition parties are not ready to let Charest off the hook. ""If Operation Mâchurer is not over, it's because Mr. Charest's friend dragged the proceedings all the way to the Supreme Court,"" said Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, the co-spokesperson for Québec Solidaire, in a news release, accusing the former provincial Liberal leader of showing contempt for the public. ""Now that Mr. Charest wants to run for the Conservative Party leadership, he's complaining about how long it's taking and he wants it to stop?"" ""The Charbonneau commission exposed the illegal financing schemes of the Liberals during the Charest era. He is the prime suspect in this case, "" said Nadeau-Dubois. ""Just because Jean Charest's lawyer asks that an investigation be stopped does not mean we should listen to him,"" said the acting head of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé. He said there are still many unanswered questions. ""Several individuals and companies claimed that they had been asked for large amounts of money,"" Bérubé said. ""Who asked them for money, and for whose benefit? That's the most important question.""

266,Anonymous,2020-01-17T09:00:00.078Z,How to reduce the carbon emissions from home heating,"Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.) This week: In cold Canadian winters, many of us burn voluminous amounts of fossil fuels to keep warm. A majority of heating systems in this country are either forced-air furnaces or boilers with hot water or steam radiators — most of which burn natural gas — and nearly 70 per cent of residential energy use comes from fossil fuels. Experts say decarbonizing heating through electrification is key to reducing our country's carbon emissions. But for many of us, giving up our furnaces and boilers is a huge step that we may not be quite ready to take. Fortunately, there are a number of smaller measures that can cut carbon emissions from our homes. David Turnbull, a former home builder and current manager at Enerspec Energy Consulting and Home Inspections in Edmonton, suggests addressing heating the way we approach waste: first, reduce the demand; then reuse whatever you can; and then tackle full decarbonization. Reduce Turnbull, who is also a board member of Built Green Canada, which focuses on improving sustainability in the residential building sector, recommends first stopping heat from leaving your home by improving the building envelope.  ""That's where you get pretty much the biggest bang for your buck up to a point,"" he said. This can be done by: Sealing gaps and air leaks with things like caulking and weather stripping. Improving insulation in the walls, basement and attic. Installing airtight, well-insulated windows. Turnbull said the best options for decarbonizing your heating system, such as heat pumps, either won't meet the home's needs or won't be cost-effective unless you've already reduced heat loss. A few other options to reduce demand include: Setting your thermostat lower, especially when you're away from home or sleeping. (Turnbull said the latter can save three to six per cent of your energy use.) Depending on your system, you may be able to do ""zoning,"" where you heat parts of the house you're in more than parts of the house that are unoccupied (such as the basement). Choosing a smaller home. Low-flow fixtures such as shower heads or tankless water heaters reduce the need to heat water. Reuse There are a couple of devices that can help you reuse ""waste"" heat: Heat recovery ventilators. Once your house is air sealed and insulated, you'll need some ventilation. Heat recovery ventilators provide this while transferring heat from the stale air leaving the house to the fresh air coming in. Drain water recovery units. Turnbull said that when you typically take a hot shower, ""you use that heat for truthfully a second — maybe less — and then all that heat goes down the drain."" This device recovers that heat and puts it back into your home. Decarbonize All done with those? The next step is looking to replace fossil fuels with efficient electric heating options such as heat pumps. (We'll have more on this next week.) — Emily Chung In last week's issue, we reported on the surprising rise in popularity of e-bikes, and how that might influence transportation in a low-carbon economy. A number of readers offered thoughtful reflections on this. That included Joseph Gore, who offered this wide-ranging analysis: ""The idea of an electric bike looks fine until you realize that in Canada for about five months of the year bikes are simply impractical. Here we need an electrical vehicle with four tires on the ground that can go through snow and not go out of control on ice. ""Canada is not the Netherlands, despite what city mayors who are frantically building bike lanes want us to believe,"" Gore said. ""The big problem with North American cities and culture is that they are built for travel by cars … and many of us live in suburbs where everyone has and needs a car. ""For decades, we have been talking about high-speed trains between Montreal and Toronto. Now that we need trains, we don't have them. Japan, China, France and even Morocco have high-speed trains, and the trains in Switzerland are amazingly reliable in summer and winter.   ""If we are serious about transitioning to a low-GHG-emission country we need an alternative to cars and planes for medium- and long-distance travel, for people and goods."" Great Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, which was largely powered by coal. This fossil fuel not only contributed to the Great Smog of 1952, which is estimated to have killed 12,000 Londoners, but it has spewed untold amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In the last few decades, however, the country has diversified its energy mix, adding significant amounts of renewable sources (wind, hydro and solar), natural gas, biomass and nuclear, as well as importing power from other countries (which could have been generated any number of ways). The overall result has been a significant reduction in carbon pollution, to the point where Britain's per capita emissions are now below 1860 (yes, 1860) levels. BlackRock, considered the world's most powerful investor (with about $7 trillion US under management), announced it is making sustainability a ""core goal"" of its investing strategy. In his annual letter to chief executives, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized that ""climate risk is investment risk."" The New York Times said BlackRock's move could ""reshape how corporate America does business and put pressure on other large money managers to follow suit.""   Lithium, a vital component in electric vehicle batteries, is a growing market, expected to near $100 billion US, by some estimates, in the next decade. Mining the metal can come at a high environmental cost, so some Alberta companies are developing greener extraction methods by partnering with an unlikely ally — the oil and gas industry. ""Working with the oil and gas industry, we can take advantage of the infrastructure already existing in Alberta,"" said Amanda Hall, president of Summit Nanotech. The infrastructure isn't the only advantage. The Leduc Formation, the source of Alberta's first big oil boom, is also a rich lithium deposit. According to the Canadian Lithium Association, there are about 3.6 million tonnes of lithium in the province.  Hall's company uses nanotechnology, which works with materials at the molecular or atomic level, to selectively filter lithium out of the wasted saltwater brine used in oil wells. ""Lithium demand is going up in the near future because of electric vehicles … so the demand for our technology is also growing,"" Hall said. Her company hopes to test the tech on oilfield sites by the end of this year, and once they're up and running, will set up modular units near well heads to filter out the metal and provide it to whoever owns the land's mineral rights — for a fee. Daniel Alessi, an associate professor at the University of Alberta, said other companies, like E3 Metals, are also working to develop different extraction methods.  Alessi said while any resource extraction technology will have some negative footprint, there are options to utilize wasted natural gas or even geothermal energy to power the extraction.  ""The big question these days is whether it's going to be economically feasible,"" Alessi said. But with companies like Tesla increasing their output of electric vehicles, demand is a sure thing.  ""Unless somebody comes with a magic new battery technology, the outlook for this region, the lithium extraction, the lithium industry, is pretty promising."" — Sarah Rieger Are there issues you'd like us to cover?

""They're great. They're pretty comfortable here this morning, having their breakfast, chewing happily and kicking at their stalls,"" Sarah Evans told CBC Radio's special storm program Saturday. Evans and another staffer stayed overnight Thursday into Friday at the Mount Scio barn, in case they couldn't get in Friday morning. They were still at Rainbow Riders Saturday morning.

Watch as Kelly Sandoval, executive director of Rainbow Riders, talks about the 'big job' of cleanup: The back of the building is snow-logged to the eaves, she said. As the winds picked up to 150 kilometres per hour, Evans said, the horses pricked up their ears and paused from eating hay. The Newfoundland ponies were running around like ""babies,"" she said.

On Saturday, the Glengarry–Prescott–Russell Provincial Liberal Association held an emergency meeting and called for would-be party leaders to commit to the open nomination.  The request came after interim leader John Fraser was asked by reporters whether Simard would automatically be the party's candidate in 2022. He said under the party's rules, incumbents don't normally to go through a nomination process.  ""You're asking us a question that's two years from now. And what's really at the core here is for Amanda to work and build up the association,"" said Fraser.  ""When we read in the paper that she would be the official candidate for the ... 2022 election, the association [rejected] that. They said, 'We want a regular nomination,'"" said Jean-Marc Lalonde, spokesperson for the association and the riding's former MPP. Lalonde said the riding association has sent a letter to all leadership candidates, urging them to implement an open nomination process in Glengarry–Prescott–Russell. The party is holding its leadership convention in March.  ""Everybody wants to make sure that we ... elect a proper member for the next election,"" said Lalonde.  Marie-Noëlle Lanthier, president of Leadership Féminin Prescott-Russell, a group that supports women in leadership and politics, believes the association's request is fair.   Simard would ""certainly"" be welcome to participate in the nomination process, she said. ""It is an important part of the democratic process, for people locally to decide who their representative will be,"" Lanthier said. ""And it's not up to the folks who are higher up in the party to make that decision, to have a handful of people making that decision for local people."" Both Lalonde and Lanthier both said the local candidate in 2018 was basically appointed by the party leadership. ""When you get a nomination evening, everybody gets involved,"" said Lalonde. ""And in this case it did not happen, so after 37 years of [having a] Liberal member in Glengarry–Prescott–Russell, we lost the election because of this procedure."" CBC News reached out to Simard over the weekend, but did not receive a response.  The association will meet Feb. 9 in St. Isidore, Ont,. to choose the delegates who will then vote on the party's new leader in March.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/glengarry-prescott-russell-provincial-liberal-association-asks-for-open-nomination-amanda-simard-1.5432752,[],/news/canada/toronto/amanda-simard-liberal-pcs-1.5429564 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-liberal-party-leadership-candidate-deadline-1.5371733
269,Anonymous,2020-01-18T02:47:21.770Z,State of emergency declared in St. John's region; raging blizzard brings eastern Newfoundland to a standstill,"The City of St. John's and neighbouring municipalities, including Mount Pearl, Paradise and Conception Bay South on Avalon Peninsula, declared a state of emergency Friday as a massive storm system moved through the eastern part of Newfoundland and Labrador. An unprecedented blizzard that is whipping its way through the region has metro St. John's hunkering down for the day for what is projected to be 75 centimetres of snow and bracing against severe weather, with winds reaching up to 150 km/h. Mass power outages have swept through the metro area, Conception Bay North, the Burin Peninsula and Gander vicinity. The CBC station in St. John's lost its backup power, but that has been restored. At 3:30 p.m. NT on Friday, Municipal Affairs and Environment Minister Derrick Bragg said people throughout the eastern region of the island, particularly in the areas around St. John's, should stay indoors.  Other communities throughout the Avalon Peninsula, on the island's east coast, issued their own states of emergency Friday afternoon, which includes Norman's Cove-Long Cove, Come By Chance, Torbay, Chapel Arm, Random Island West and Portugal Cove-St. Philip's. Bragg told CBC News that 25 of 26 snow clearing depots have been closed in eastern Newfoundland. ""With no snow clearing on the main highways, fire trucks and ambulances and all first responders would not, right now, be able to reach you in most cases,"" Bragg said. ""Please, don't do anything that would endanger the lives of first responders by putting these people out in these conditions. If the snowplow people are off the roads, you can be pretty sure it's not safe to be out."" There was a form of an avalanche in The Battery area of St. John’s, which is that picturesque village on the side of the harbour. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nltraffic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nltraffic</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cbcnl?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cbcnl</a> At 9 p.m. the province's department of transportation and works said it's still too dangerous for plows to be operating. Many pieces of equipment as far west as Badger, about 450 kilometres west of St. John's, have been taken off highways due to unsafe conditions. Plow operators have responded to 105 requests for assistance so far on Friday, 24 from ambulances, 21 from police and 60 from the public, according to the department. The department anticipates snow clearing to begin Saturday morning, adding that approximately 65 centimetres of snow has fallen in the St. John's area so far. According to Bragg, warming centres have been organized by municipalities, but it's important to locate your nearest one before you lose power. Bragg said there is a plan in place where most municipalities have a loader or piece of snow-clearing equipment stationed in front of their fire halls. Premier Dwight Ball spoke with CBC News on Friday evening. He reminded the public to reach 511, the province's travel information service, in the event of emergencies, either by phone or by visiting 511nl.ca. The service offers current updates on highway conditions for the entire province, and in the event of an emergency, the assistance of a snowplow operator to help with other emergency services, such as ambulances. Judy O'Keefe, Eastern Health's vice-president of clinical services, said the health authority is advising staff not to report to work Friday evening or Saturday morning under the metro-area's current state of emergency. Staff currently at work are advised that they cannot leave, due to safety concerns. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen declared the state of emergency at 11 a.m., directing all businesses to close. All vehicles, except for emergency crews, have been instructed to leave the roads. ""Anybody that's out right now, you need to return to your home and you need to stay there until we lift the state of emergency,"" Breen told CBC News. Breen also told CBC that the state of emergency in St. John's is unlikely to be lifted on Saturday to give road crews a chance to clear. At 6 p.m., St. John's temporarily suspended all snow-clearing operations. However, snowplow operators remain on standby at various locations throughout the city, including hospitals, fire departments and the Battery neighbourhood, according to the city. As of 8 p.m., A part of the Battery neighbourhood was being evacuated due to an avalanche warning. Breen said 311 is still available, and city staff are ready for emergency calls. At 4:30 p.m., Bonavista Mayor John Norman declared a state of emergency for the town about 300 kilometres northwest of St. John's. Norman said all town staff have been pulled from the roads and advised residents to call 911 with emergencies. In the event of a medical emergency, Norman said a town plow will be available as an escort to the hospital. The town of Paradise has also removed its snow-clearing equipment from its streets. Over 75 centimetres of snow is expected to fall on the Avalon Peninsula by Friday night, while winds are expected to gust to as high as 150 km/h in coastal areas. The storm is so powerful that the Newfoundland and Labrador government pulled its plows from regional highways. Transportation Minister Steve Crocker said the main issue was visibility, with windshields granting views to little more than a solid plane of white. ""It's no longer safe. You can just imagine, the size of the equipment that our operators are operating, and they're out there and they don't know where a road ends or where a road begins in a lot of cases."" Premier Ball said the province is bringing in snow-clearing equipment from the west coast of the island to assist in the cleanup on the east coast.   ""A lot of the work is happening today in preparation for when the storm is finally over, that we have supports in place to support those areas that need the extra equipment and human resources to get to the cleanup,"" he said. CBC meteorologists Ryan Snoddon and Ashley Brauweiler continue to track the blizzard, with updates which will see the strongest winds yet to come. According to Snoddon, the Avalon Peninsula will feel the strongest winds by 6 p.m. Friday, but will taper slightly overnight and into Saturday morning. Snoddon said Saturday afternoon will be a good window for those attempting to dig out, with winds expecting to hover around 80 km/h. The Bonavista Peninsula will continue to deal with strong winds overnight and into Saturday. The Avalon Peninsula is expected to see a mix of rain and snow on Sunday and into the overnight, with rain or drizzle expected for Monday. An RCMP spokesperson for the province had stern words for anybody thinking of driving in a non-emergency. ""It's no joke, this is not a 'nice to.' We're really saying, 'Stay off the road,'"" said Const. Jolene Garlene. To everyone in NL affected by the storm, please listen to your local authorities. We want you to stay safe, and keep the roads clear for emergency vehicles &amp; snow clearing. <a href=""https://twitter.com/BillBlair?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@BillBlair</a> is in contact with the province &amp; is monitoring the situation. We’re ready to help if needed. She explained that officers have already been called to help drivers who've gone off the road and are stuck, but she said police on the island have limited capacity and ability to help in current conditions without putting themselves at risk. Conditions steadily deteriorated through the morning, with visibility getting worse as winds pick up. Mayor Breen indicated the potential for power failures was a deciding factor in ordering the state of emergency. ""When you get the high winds like that, and the snow, there's just so many issues at play that you really do need to just shut it down — get everything cleaned up,"" Breen said, adding he doesn't recall the city facing such a severe storm in decades. The last time St. John's declared a state of emergency was an ice storm that struck the region in 1984, he said. Breen said he isn't sure at this point when the order will be lifted, as much depends on cleanup that the city had already struggled with after back-to-back storms. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District closed a slew of schools in the eastern and central regions, while Memorial University, the Marine Institute and the College of the North Atlantic were also shut for the day. John Fisher of Fisher's Loft in Port Rexton, N.L., said his anemometer hit 160 km/h Friday afternoon, the highest Fisher said he has ever seen. Ball said the provincial government is working closely with the federal government. ""The prime minister, I know, has reached out today — so has the local MP and the local minister here,"" he said. ""So everybody is engaged in this — working with communities. Once the storm is over they will support the cleanup, and it will take some time. So we're asking people to be patient."" Metrobus cancelled its public transit service before snow even fell, following up with a statement that it will also not be running on Saturday. Most flights are cancelled at St. John's International Airport. The state of emergency order affects taxis. Jiffy Cabs, one of the best-known companies in St. John's, said it is the first time in the business's history that it ever pulled its entire fleet off the road. The Marine Atlantic ferry service has cancelled its morning crossings between North Sydney, N.S., and Port aux Basques, N.L. Winds picked up early Friday morning and snow started falling around 4:30 a.m.  Read more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/blizzard-newfoundland-1.5430457,[],[]
270,Lenard Monkman,2020-01-18T09:00:00.734Z,Showcase encourages Indigenous people to pursue careers in aviation industry,"Nicole Kemp was still in high school when she decided that she wanted to work in aviation.  ""It's just something my uncle told me about when I was 16 years old,"" said Kemp. ""He was describing his friend's job to me and I guess that's when I decided that this is what I'm going to do.""  On Wednesday, Kemp was one of the keynote speakers at an aerospace and aviation showcase aimed at getting more Indigenous people involved in the industry.  Speaking to a group of over 200 Indigenous adult education students at the Neeginan Centre in Winnipeg, Kemp talked about having a son while she was still in high school and having to wait an extra year to apply for the Aircraft Maintenance Engineer program at the Stevenson Campus at Red River College. Kemp had another child before she finished the program and has been working as an aircraft maintenance engineer for 13 years. One of her favourite things about fixing planes is that her days are never filled with the same tasks.  ""I get to think outside the box a lot… I'm small so I can't physically do some of the things a man can do, but I can get the job done,"" said Kemp. Now working at Keewatin Air, an air medical and air transport service operating in Manitoba and Nunavut, Kemp said that there are still very few Indigenous people that she knows who are working within the industry. According to a 2018 labour market report by the Canadian Council for Aviation and Aerospace, Indigenous people make up four per cent of the general workforce but only three per cent of the total aerospace workforce. Kimberly Ballantyne has wanted to be a pilot since she was four. Her career journey has seen her go back and forth between her community, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, and Winnipeg, working in human resources and marketing, and now she's working on getting her private pilot's licence. In 2019 she applied for a job as a recruitment specialist with Manitoba Aerospace. Not too long after being hired, she pitched to them the idea of hosting a career fair aimed specifically at Indigenous people. According to a 2018 labour market Information study compiled by Manitoba Aerospace, there will be a need for over 2,000 workers in Manitoba's aerospace and aviation industries over the next three to five years. The industry is hoping to tap into an underutilized Indigenous workforce. Ballantyne said one of the common misconceptions that Indigenous people have about gaining employment within the industry is that you need a lengthy post-secondary education. ""Some of the training can take up to 10 months,"" she said. ""And like I mentioned Neeginan College of Applied Technology offers that training right here in-house."" Ballantyne invited over 20 different aviation companies and organizations to set up a booth at the event. One of them was Michelle Carrier's. Carrier is a recruiter for the University of Manitoba's Engineering Access Program (ENGAP). The program has an aerospace option and she said it's important for Indigenous people to be a part of designing things in the future. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/aviation-careers-event-winnipeg-1.5431510,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/medevac-robyn-shlachetla-raven-beardy-missinippi-1.4567270,/news/canada/manitoba/medevac-robyn-shlachetla-raven-beardy-missinippi-1.4567270 /news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-indigenous-pilot-1.4979803 /news/canada/north/fort-smith-school-aviation-2-year-program-1.5422590
271,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-05-06T11:36:21.452Z,Brothers have the same deadly disease but only 1 gets what their parents hope is life-saving treatment,"Two young brothers, both with a deadly genetic disease, could face two very different futures because only one has access to cutting-edge medication. Andre Larocque, 8, and his younger brother, Joshua, 6, have cystic fibrosis.   The relatively rare disease leads to the destruction of the lungs and an early death for most people who have it. There is no cure. Once lung function is lost, there is no way to get it back. ""When I put them to bed at night, I hear Andre go to sleep peacefully and then I hear Josh laying awake in his bed coughing himself to sleep,"" mother Sasha Haughian said during an interview from the family's home in the small Ontario town of New Tecumseth. ""I don't know how to describe the feeling of listening to that and knowing it's just gonna get worse."" Andre is on a medication called Symdeko through a drug trial, but Joshua wasn't selected for the trial and has no access to two similar Health Canada-approved medications. That's because the Ontario government doesn't fund the drugs for the vast majority of cystic fibrosis patients and his parents can't afford to pay out of pocket. ""It's a progressive, fatal disease ... we have medication right now that more than half the population [with cystic fibrosis] could benefit from, and we're not getting access to it,"" Haughian said. About 4,200 Canadians have cystic fibrosis. There are three gene-modifying drugs available — Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi — that are believed to slow down lung damage caused by the disease. Other treatments only ease symptoms. Access to all three medications is severely limited.  Unlike many other countries, Canada does not have a special process for evaluating drugs for rare diseases. Clinical trials for such drugs are limited by their small pool of potential participants. This makes proving a drug's effectiveness more difficult — which makes convincing provincial governments and private insurers to cover the cost for patients more unlikely, health advocates say. ""It's a heartbreaking situation ... These are symptoms of a larger issue, which is essentially our system was not built to evaluate and fairly assess drugs for rare diseases,"" said Kim Steele, director of government and community relations for Cystic Fibrosis Canada.  Haughian and her husband, Jamie Larocque, say Symdeko has been a life-changer for Andre since he started taking it in January 2018. While he can run around and play hockey with his friends, his younger brother's condition is deteriorating.  ""When we first found out Andre was accepted for the trial, we were so excited,"" Larocque said. ""And then after a couple days, I realized, 'Oh wait, Josh has nothing.' Now that it's been over a year, we're really starting to see Andre just shoot ahead and Josh falling behind, and that's tough."" The family and their doctor believe Orkambi would change that. But the family can't afford the annual cost of $250,000. Their private health-care plan won't pay for it either. They are desperate for Ontario to cover the medication for their younger son. They say the criteria for who qualifies for coverage are too strict.  The medication is only funded for children between the ages of six and 17 who are really sick for a long time — it's called the ""exceptional cases"" criteria. To qualify, a patient must show that they lost 20 per cent of their lung function for a six-week period over the course of six months. That's the standard in three provinces — Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The other provinces and territories don't cover the drug at all and no province funds the drug for adults. Under the rules, less than two per cent of children with cystic fibrosis qualify for Orkambi coverage in Ontario, according to Cystic Fibrosis Canada. And Joshua isn't one of them.  The Ontario Health Ministry says it has not received any requests for coverage since the introduction of the exceptional cases criteria on Feb. 20. The board that recommends whether medications should be publicly funded is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). It's made up of representatives from the health-care system, academia and the public. It decided there wasn't enough evidence of therapeutic value to recommend governments cover Orkambi, but provinces aren't bound by CADTH's decisions.  Steele says a lot of good medications are rejected for coverage because the testing criteria are designed for drugs that treat more common diseases and can be evaluated in large clinical trials. ""We can't do that in small populations. And so, often when our evidence goes to the table for government to look at, they say there's not enough evidence. And our problem is there's not enough people to give you the evidence that you want."" Then there is the cost.  ""It's expensive,"" Steele said. ""I'm not going to shy away from saying price is definitely a concern. However, it's very hard to put a price on life."" The three cystic fibrosis drugs are priced at about $250,000 a year in Canada. But Chris MacLeod, chair of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society, which advocates that patients with the disease should have access to any medication their doctor prescribes, says that doesn't reflect what the real cost would be if Canada did a better job negotiating with drug companies. He points to other countries where the drugs are available for less than half that price.  The problem, he says, is Canada does not negotiate prices with drug companies until the end of the CADTH review, so many drugs end up being rejected for coverage because of cost. In some cases, provinces won't negotiate at all, or they go it alone instead of negotiating on a national scale and buying in bulk to lower the cost. ""Canada is an outlier. We're the only developed country that either doesn't have a deal, or isn't negotiating a deal,"" MacLeod said of Orkambi. ""Quite frankly, I think it's bureaucrats that have become so baked in the system that they've lost perspective."" Meanwhile, Canadians like Joshua Larocque go without the medications they need, he said. ""It's shameful. Absolutely shameful."" MacLeod is also a lawyer and is heading up a class action lawsuit against the B.C. government, federal government, CADTH and others over the lack of funding for Orkambi. The suit claims governments are ""denying access to lifesaving drugs in a very non-transparent, non-evidence-based manner."" None of the allegations has been proven in court. In an email to Go Public, B.C.'s Ministry of Health said CADTH recommended Orkambi not be funded due to a lack of evidence on two separate occasions.  ""These recommendations are based on clinical and cost factors,"" a spokesperson said. ""And with Vertex setting the cost of Orkambi at $250,000 a year per patient, its cost is unsustainable for public and private drug plans."" In an email to Go Public, a CADTH spokesperson said that over the past five years, the agency has taken steps to clarify and enhance processes to address the unique challenges of evaluating drugs for rare diseases.  Andre and Joshua's parents have repeatedly reached out to Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott.  In October, the family asked for a meeting with Elliott. They said they were told by her office it would happen. They're still waiting to hear when, and their followup messages have gone unanswered.  As opposition health critic, Elliott criticized the government at the time for not funding Kalydeco, one of the three gene-modifying cystic fibrosis medications. The drug was later added to the coverage list in Ontario, but few patients qualify. It's a similar story with Orkambi. In February, Ontario agreed to fund the drug on a case-by-case basis under what's called the Exceptional Access Program. So far, not one cystic fibrosis patient has qualified for provincial coverage under the program's criteria, said MacLeod.   Watch: Elliott challenged the Liberal government to cover Kalydeco several years ago when she was Opposition health critic. The minister turned down a request for an interview with Go Public and didn't respond to specific questions we sent about Joshua and Andre's situation and about access to the cystic fibrosis medications, providing instead a general statement from a spokesperson.  ""Young Ontarians with rare diseases deserve every opportunity to enjoy healthy and happy childhoods,"" spokesperson Hayley Chazan wrote in an email to Go Public.  ""Orkambi, which helps treat pediatric cystic fibrosis, is currently considered for funding in Ontario in exceptional cases … consistent with clinical evidence."" Joshua and Andre's parents are still hopeful the federal government will deliver on a 2019 federal budget promise to implement a rare disease strategy that could help people like Joshua. The family believes Andre will continue to get access to Symdeko indefinitely. The trial is to test the medication on younger children and track it as they grow. It's already approved by Health Canada for children ages 12 and older. Vertex Pharmaceuticals makes both Orkambi and Symdeko. It tells Go Public it has no plans to ask CADTH to review Symdeko for provincial funding, saying the present system for assessing drug coverage in Canada ""has challenges.""  When asked why the cost of Orkambi is so high, Vertex didn't answer, but Cystic Fibrosis Canada says developing medications for rare disease is expensive because the market for them is so small. ""That leaves Symdeko and the other drugs coming down the pipeline completely inaccessible,"" Haughian said. ""Without a proper rare disease strategy for evaluating drugs in place, there is not much incentive for drug companies to even try to develop drugs for rare diseases."" She and her husband worry their younger son will never get the medication he needs. ""I fear Joshua will spend his childhood getting sicker, living in and out of the hospital, needing more and more treatments, and ultimately dying young,"" Haughian told Go Public in an email after the interview, because she didn't want her sons to hear about her fears. ""While Andre is out playing hockey and hanging with friends … and as he gets older and understands more and more, the 'survivor's guilt' he could potentially feel is a dangerous thing.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

272,Anonymous,2020-01-18T17:14:33.959Z,Protests close Louvre museum in Paris amid pension strikes,"Dozens of protesters blocked the entrance to the Louvre museum and forced the famous Paris landmark to close Friday while they denounced the French government's plans to overhaul the pension system. Protesters later chased down President Emmanuel Macron at an evening theatre performance in northern Paris. Video showed protesters chanting and some entering a door as surprised police tried to hold them back. A black car reportedly carrying Macron then sped away under a hail of boos. An edgy tension marked the day as small but determined groups of protesters moved into action to make their complaints against pension changes heard. It was the 44th day of strikes aimed at overturning the plan. The protesters at the Louvre, who included some museum employees, staged the demonstration against Macron's proposals after several hard-left trade unions appealed for public actions to oppose a plan that they said would ""lower everyone's pensions."" The museum's Leonardo da Vinci exhibit marking the 500th anniversary of the Italian master's death was included in the closure. Some protesters chanted, ""Mona Lisa is on strike, Leonardo is on strike."" It is the first time since railway strikes and protests against the pension overhaul began on Dec. 5 that the Louvre and its da Vinci exhibit were fully shut down. About 30,000 people visit the museum every day. Some videos on social media showed angry visitors booing at museum protesters to express their disappointment. Some of those shut out of the Louvre were upset, while a few interviewed expressed solidarity with the strikers. ""I think it's fine if they want to protest but they shouldn't block the plans of the people who have flown over here to see an exhibition of Leonardo,"" said Ben Garrett of Dallas. Gerhard Jehle of Germany, who had bought his ticket in advance, shared that view, and said he was ""badly informed about the extent of the strike."" ""I don't understand how this happens,"" Jehle said. ""Public transport doesn't function. The unions have to be controlled with an iron hand."" Argentinian Marcelo Campano, who also had a ticket, said that he understands workers' bid to confront a government they perceive as ""neo-liberal ... So we'll show our solidarity and come back another day."" The action at the Louvre was one of several signs of mounting tensions among strikers. Several dozen people on Friday invaded the headquarters of the CFDT union, which is favourable to a point system Macron wants to put in place to determine retirement benefits. The invaders were seen on video singing and mocking the union's leader. Macron condemned the action as violent, unacceptable and ""shameful for our democracy."" In a more playful bid for attention, dozens of lawyers opposing the president's proposed pension reforms put on a dance show in Versailles wearing their black robes. Unions have called for a seventh round of street marches next Friday, when the contested pension plan is to be presented to the cabinet. The weeks of strikes and protests have hobbled public transportation and disrupted schools, hospitals, courthouses and even opera houses and the Eiffel Tower. Major French retailers Fnac Darty and Casino said that business in France has been badly affected by the strikes, especially during the holiday season. Fnac Darty said the strikes cost it around 70 million euros ($101 million Cdn) in lost revenue. Casino cut its forecast for earnings growth in France, where it does more than half its business, to five per cent in 2019, from a previous 10 per cent. The company estimates that the strikes in December cost it about 80 million euros ($116 million Cdn) in lost revenue. Shares in both companies were down by more than five per cent. The prime minister's office said earlier this week that the SNCF train authority and the RATP, which runs public transport, had lost over a billion euros since the start of the strike. Trains have suffered most, so far losing some 850 million euros ($1.2 billion Cdn). While the number of striking workers has diminished since the movement, the country's trains and the Paris subway were still disrupted Friday. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/pension-protests-shut-down-louvre-1.5432132,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/40-days-of-strikes-show-french-fondness-for-revolution-over-reform-1.5430839 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-strike-1.5399580,/news/world/40-days-of-strikes-show-french-fondness-for-revolution-over-reform-1.5430839 /news/world/france-strike-1.5399580 /news/world/protesters-occupy-gare-de-lyon-station-1.5406559
273,Anonymous,2020-01-19T23:00:00.177Z,Redblacks owner aiming to resurrect pro soccer in Ottawa,"An Ottawa businessman who played a major role in bringing the CFL back to the nation's capital has confirmed he's now trying to do the same thing for professional soccer. Jeff Hunt, one of the owners of the Ottawa Redblacks, told Radio-Canada Friday he's the local investor in a bid to bring a Canadian Premier League (CPL) club to the city. The city's former soccer team, Ottawa Fury FC, announced in November it was suspending operations after failing to obtain sanctioning from the governing bodies that oversee the United Soccer League (USL). Fury FC had played in that league since 2017 and was its only Canadian team. Hunt is also a board member with the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group (OSEG), which operated the club, along with the Redblacks and the Ontario Hockey League's Ottawa 67's. Rumours had been circulating on social media for a few days that pro soccer could be returning to Ottawa before Hunt confirmed his involvement this weekend. Hunt called it ""very big news,"" adding that negotiations with the CPL had been going on for some time. He also said he was investing on his own, not with OSEG. CONCACAF, the governing body that oversees soccer in Canada, had made it clear it wanted the now-defunct Fury FC to be part of the CPL when the league launched in April 2019, rather than continue playing in a league dominated by U.S. teams. In late 2018 it revoked the sanctioning that would have allowed Fury FC to remain in the USL, despite the fact the start of that league's season was only a few months away. After a strong outcry from OSEG, CONCACAF reversed the decision. The club played one final season in the USL before ceasing operations. The seven-team CPL wrapped up its debut season in November, with Hamilton's Forge FC beating Calgary's Cavalry FC in the league's inaugural championship. If the current bid is successful, Ottawa would be home to the league's eighth club. It's not clear yet when the team would take to the pitch.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/jeff-hunt-ottawa-soccer-canadian-premier-league-1.5432238,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/fury-suspends-operation-failed-sanctions-1.5352935 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-fury-fc-fans-react-1.5354040,/news/canada/ottawa/fury-suspends-operation-failed-sanctions-1.5352935 /news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-fury-fc-fans-react-1.5354040
274,Jonathan Ventura,2020-01-16T19:59:09.789Z,"Do you know how much your car is costing you? How going car-free saved one Manitoban $6,400 last year","Most Canadians have no idea how much their car truly costs them every year. When one Manitoban did the math, she decided to get rid of hers — and she says she has no plans of going back.  ""When you really add up the costs and divide them over the year I think most people spend … a lot more than they think they do,"" said intern architecht Erin Riediger,​ who estimates her transportation costs last year were about a quarter what they would have been if she owned a car. She sold her car three and a half years ago when the cost of repairs became too high, and now relies on walking, biking, busing, carpooling, and using Winnipeg's car share co-op to get around. The costs of depreciation, fuel, maintenance, and insurance all add up for most Canadians, Statistics Canada says. According to the agency's Household Spending Survey, the average cost of private transport in Canada is $11,433 a year. Using resources like CAA's car calculator and some simple budgeting, Riediger estimated owning a basic compact car would cost her approximately $8,600 a year. But she calculates that she saved about $6,400 last year by keeping her total 2019 transportation expenses to just over $2,200 — which included about $950 to buy two new bikes and getting some work done to another. Without those one-time expenses, she says she would've spent an average of about $100 on transportation per month last year — a yearly savings of more than $7,000 versus owning a car. Riediger's commute varies on the weather. In the summer she uses her bike, while in early December she starts riding the bus. On weekends or evenings she walks or uses a vehicle from Peg City Car Co-op, a buy-in car share program that charges members an hourly and kilometre rate, in exchange for covering insurance, gas, parking and maintenance. She's far from alone in relying on the car share. Peg City says in the last eight years, it's grown from a fleet of two vehicles to 42, and from 40 members to 1,700. Growing up in in Charleswood, near the western edge of the city, Riediger says she grew accustomed to having a car. Now, she says not owning a car is a lifestyle she doesn't want to give up. ""[I've] debated the pros and cons, and the big things for me are lifestyle and also finances I can save."" It's a decision that she says has benefits not just for her wallet, but also for her health and the environment.  Walking or biking to the grocery store now feels less like a chore, she said, and more of an opportunity for exercise and fresh air. Not all of the commuters CBC News spoke to were sold on the idea of going car-free, though. For some, the financial costs of owning a car are worth the benefits in a city like Winnipeg. ""Winnipeg has a perception that you kinda need a car to live in this city, [with] everything being so spaced out,"" said commuter Denis Cicak. ""When it's –30, you're not going to wait half an hour for a bus."" Cicak says where he lives would be a big factor in determining what other forms of transportation he might consider. Riediger understands that changing commuting method can seem daunting. She admits that many are discouraged by bus schedules and unprotected bike routes.  ""It's a little bit of a chicken and egg scenario, because you need better transit to get more people to take transit but also you need people taking transit to be able to pay for it.""  Orly Linovski, an assistant professor in the University of Manitoba's department of city planning, understands that other modes of transportation need to be made easy — but that's not the only factor to consider when it comes to driving less. ""The environmental benefits are huge. When we're in the midst of a climate crisis we probably cannot overstate that,"" Linovski said. ""There's impacts for your health. Even if you use public transportation, the vast majority of public transit trips have some amount of walking with it."" Linovksi also said she sees more people who aren't necessarily giving up their cars entirely, but are reducing car use by choosing different transportation methods for different trips. Riediger agrees everyone needs to find the approach that works best for them. ""I'm not going to tell anybody how they should live … it's not about taking people's cars away,"" she said, though she encourages others to try living without owning a car. ""If you just try it you're going to feel lifestyle improvements beyond just the cost savings.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/car-free-winnipeg-1.5428775,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/car-culture-urban-planning-road-safety-winnipeg-1.5189392 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sask-new-car-registrations-down-1.5365234,[]
275,Morgan Modjeski,2020-01-20T14:58:07.448Z,Meeting San Francisco 49ers 'dream come true' for young Regina football fan ,"The look on Boston Schaan's face is one of pure excitement. Decked out from head-to-toe in San Francisco 49ers gear, the 13-year-old is surrounded by many of the massive NFL football players during the club's practice on Sunday. ""You guys ready for the game tomorrow?"" the youngster roars into the crowd, which erupts into cheers. ""Niners on three,"" he yells as he puts his fist into the centre of the huddle. ""One! Two! Three! Niners!"" Video of the meeting was shared to the more than two million people who follow the NFL club's official Twitter account and by Sunday morning, it had been viewed by more than 50,000 people. ""Break it down, Boston!"" the NFL club said in the Tweet. Break it down, Boston! <br><br>Ahead of the NFC Championship, 13-year-old Boston Schaan from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada had his Wish granted of getting to meet the team today. ❤️<a href=""https://twitter.com/SFWish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@SFWish</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/MakeAWish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@MakeAWish</a> <a href=""https://t.co/JiYKSFQIAB"">pic.twitter.com/JiYKSFQIAB</a> Schaan, who is from Regina, is in San Francisco with his family to meet the 49ers as part of a wish granted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The youngster has cystic fibrosis.  They attended the NFL club's practice on Saturday and took in the action as the 49ers beat the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night in the National Football Conference Championship. The 49ers win means the team will play Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl on Feb. 2. He says the trip will be one to remember. ""I didn't really expect the whole tour of the stadium,"" said Boston in an interview with CBC  from San Francisco on Sunday. ""It was a really cool experience throughout the whole time that we were there.""  He was also able to walk away with a piece of NFL history, as 49ers tight-end George Kittle gave the youngster a pair of signed gloves he wore in a previous game. Despite the fact Boston is only 13, he said he's been a fan of the 49ers for years and admires their play style. ""I've always liked to watch them and how they play, so it's pretty cool to meet them face-to-face for the first time,"" he said. The youngster also said it's important that he got to experience the trip as a family, noting they've always looked out for and supported him. Darren Schaan, Boston's father, said the team was ""amazing."" ""They were just so happy to have him there,"" he said.  ""We were kind of blown away by the fact that this is a big playoff game coming up and here they're taking time out of their day and preparation to make something so special for him."" Patti Schaan, Boston's grandma, said she'll be tuning into Sunday's game for sure. She said the experience has been a ""dream come true"" for her young grandson.  ""I think we're all thrilled,"" she said, as numerous family members have been reaching out to share their best wishes. ""Even feeling to the point of tears that we're so happy for him."" Patti said she's watched the video posted to the 49ers Twitter account and said it was an important moment for her to watch. ""It was very exciting and touching that he's getting to do this,"" she said. Plus, the trip has been a big boost for the young football fan.

276,Nicole Mortillaro,2020-01-16T16:32:18.723Z,"No one will be untouched by a warming planet, scientists say","On Wednesday, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released their annual report on global temperatures and climate conditions — 2019 was the second warmest year on record, and the past decade was the warmest ever. These types of temperature milestones are the norm now; every month it seems another record is set, and every year we reach another global warming milestone.  In fact, the hottest years on record have all occurred since 2005, according to the report.  But scientists say rising heat is about more than just numbers; behind those statistics are consequences for people, their livelihoods and our delicate ecosystems. Climate change is costing cities as they try to adapt and mitigate. Farmers are facing increasing challenges, which can lead to consumers paying more for food. Extreme weather disasters are on the rise in Canada and costing insurance companies, leading to higher premiums. People are dying in heat waves which are set to become more frequent as the planet warms; and hurricanes are stalling, meaning more people are in danger for longer periods of time.  ""In my line of work, we do track the numbers and we do try to quantify the behaviour of the climate system, but ultimately what really matters is where it intersects and impacts with the people we love and the things we do,"" said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). In our normal, day-to-day lives, the effects of a warming planet may not be so evident to most Canadians. But to some, it's all too real. The most dramatic changes are found in the north. The region is warming almost three times faster than the planet as a whole, resulting in record-low sea ice levels in the Arctic and melting permafrost. These occurrences have consequences. They're taking a toll on ecosystems — and on the people who have called the cold, icy area home for centuries. Inuit are losing their homes. They are losing their way of life. They are falling through the rapidly thinning ice while hunting. The warming is also affecting the mental health of people who had cherished longer winters and persistent cold. To people who have long relied on the consistency of the cold north, the change is all too real. Farmers are also particularly vulnerable to climate change. ""Some people who work in weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture … are seeing [climate change] on an annual basis, and they're seeing [it] through greater extremes, and they're also seeing it in the greater variability, the wild swings,"" said Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.  Phillips' annual list of Canada's top ten weather stories cited the terrible farming season in the Prairies in 2019. The weather went from dry before the planting season even began for many, to too wet from June to August, followed by an early snowfall at the start of harvest time in September. This meant a lot of crops remained unharvested. John Guelly, chair of the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said the 2019 growing season was ""the harvest from hell.""  Guelly, who has been a farmer for the past 30 years just northwest of Edmonton, plants canola, wheat and barley, with 1,000 acres of crops.  ""In our particular region, where I farm, it's actually been the fourth really lousy harvest season we've had in a row,"" he said. ""It's definitely taking its toll on people."" But not all the challenges have been the same. In 2018, smoke from the B.C. fires reduced sunlight, for example. And with climate change forecast to create drier conditions in some regions, this may be a sign of things to come. ""If you'd asked a farmer before Christmas what they wanted for Christmas, it was 'Can the growing season be normal next year?'"" Guelly said. "" What's normal anymore? We're not sure."" The fires raging in Australia are just a recent example of the challenges a continuously warming Earth will present. To date, 28 people have died, including two firemen, and millions of animals are thought to have perished.  Then there are hurricanes. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian sat almost immovable above Abaco Island in the Bahamas for more almost 24 hours, killing at least 70 people. Heat waves killed an estimated 1,500 people in France in 2019. The good news is this is far below the 2003 heat wave that killed an estimated 30,000 across Europe, with 14,000 in France alone. And here at home, a heat wave killed 66 people in Montreal in 2018. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international humanitarian medical organization, believes places like South Asia and the Pacific region, the Middle East, the Sahelian Belt, and Southern Africa are particularly at risk. Carol Devine, a humanitarian advisor at MSF focusing on human health and climate change, said she's concerned about what the future holds.  ""Vulnerable people tend to become more vulnerable, and climate change exacerbates health issues,"" she said.  ""Climate-sensitive diseases — that concerns us,"" said added. ""All these pieces interconnect somehow: climate-sensitive diseases, water and food insecurity, malnutrition related to drought or micronutrients or salinity coming into crops."" She's seen certain diseases move into areas that hadn't faced them before, leaving some local doctors unable to adequately treat patients. ""There are already so many vulnerabilities, so what's to come?"" she said. While not all weather events are a result of climate change, climate change can exacerbate them. It upsets a delicately balanced Earth system. And scientists are getting better at teasing out weather from the changing climate, improving attribution.  But, without curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the future contains a lot of upheaval and big impacts on people's lives. ""No area will be immune from it,"" Phillips said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-2019-1.5427586,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ice-free-arctic-1.5291966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/australia-bushfires-1.5414325 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/blackrock-investment-climate-change-1.5426465,/news/technology/hottest-decade-1.5427846 /news/technology/ice-free-arctic-1.5291966 /news/technology/population-climate-change-1.5331133 /news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154
277,Anonymous,2020-01-20T20:40:02.548Z,Ontario education minister cites 'hardship on parents' as elementary teachers start strikes,"Ontario's elementary teachers started a week of rotating one-day strikes today, shutting down schools in three boards. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (EFTO) is holding its first strikes today in the Toronto, York Region and Ottawa-Carleton school boards. Some 170,000 students in Toronto alone will be affected by the job action. Teachers carrying signs gathered outside schools in the frigid weather in the morning, at times joined by parents and other community members. The strikes will hit different boards each day this week as tensions escalate between the union and the Progressive Conservative government. This morning, ETFO president Sam Hammond said that the organization has had no ""meaningful"" progress in talks with the government since negotiations began in August. The two sides last met on Dec. 19, and new dates for continued discussions have been publicly released. Full-day kindergarten, support for students with special education needs and hiring practices for occasional teachers have been particularly contentious issues between ETFO and the province, Hammond said, as well as a rate-of-inflation wage increase for teachers and education support workers. Premier Doug Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce have said compensation is the primary sticking point. Last November, the PCs passed a bill that caps public sector yearly wage increases at one per cent for the next three years. Multiple unions have launched legal challenges to the legislation.  Ford said last week that he has no intention of reconsidering the wage increase limit.  Lecce said the strikes have ""imposed hardship on parents in this province. ""We owe it to the students of this province to not withdraw services from them and ensure there is a continuum of learning,"" he told reporters Monday afternoon.  ""I think kids are clearly paying the price because of the continuous, union-led escalation."" Watch how some Ontario families are preparing for a week of rotating teachers' strikes: Speaking to CBC Radio's Metro Morning, Hammond said ETFO is willing to continue negotiations if the mediator sets new dates. ""We need to be at a table and we need to actually have a willing partner on the other side to negotiate. And there are still a number of issues on the table,"" he said. Lecce has proposed hiring a private mediator, saying that a different approach could help break the gridlock between the two sides. Hammond has rejected the proposal. The current mediator was assigned by the Ministry of Labour. ""It's high time for us to consider that,"" he said Monday. Parents join teachers on the picket line at Carleton Village Public School with a community picket in support of this one day strike. School is cancelled in Toronto, York, and Ottawa public schools <a href=""https://t.co/29AIHDlZbI"">pic.twitter.com/29AIHDlZbI</a> All four major teachers unions are engaged in job action as they negotiate new collective agreements with the government. The Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) is holding its seventh one-day walk-out at some boards on Tuesday, forcing exams in some schools to be rescheduled. The union says it will be its last one-day strike until the exam period is over. Lecce told Metro Morning that the ministry has made ""pretty substantive"" policy concessions to assuage the OSSTF, including backing off a decision to increase the average high school class size and reducing the number of mandatory e-learning courses for high school students to two rather than four. ""We've made some moves, and it requires an element of reciprocity from the teachers unions to do the same,"" he said. When asked if the government would legislate teachers back to work in the case of a full strike, Lecce said his focus right now is on securing deals with each of the unions.  Members of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association will also strike for a day on Tuesday.  Only the union representing teachers in Ontario's French school system has contract talks scheduled with the government, even as they began a work-to-rule campaign last week. Faced with ramped up action from the unions, the government announced last week that it would compensate parents affected by the elementary teacher strikes. Under the plan, parents whose kids aren't yet enrolled in school but attend school-based child-care centres affected by the strikes will get the most money — $60 per day — while those with children in grades 1 through 7 will get the least — $25. While parents of secondary school students won't get any funding, those with children with special needs up to age 21 will get $40 per day — the same amount as parents whose kids are in kindergarten. Lecce said more than 120,000 parents have signed up for that program, which could cost the government $48 million per day if teachers from all school boards were to strike. That's less than the $60 million per day the government spends in teacher compensation, he added. Corrigan Hammond, a father who walked a picket line with teachers at Carleton Village Junior and Senior Public School in Toronto, said the money will do little for his family amid the strike. Hammond, who has no relation to the ETFO's Sam Hammond, told CBC News he took the day off work to care for his son and a friend. ""I'm not earning any money because I'm self-employed,"" he said, adding that more strikes in the Toronto public board would be a significant expense. But Hammond said he still wanted to show support for striking teachers. ""We think it's important to stand up for our teachers ... and we don't believe that the government is behaving in good faith.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-ford-unions-what-need-know-1.5429092 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-teachers-unions-update-1.5429134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-labour-action-1.5425586,/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-ford-unions-what-need-know-1.5429092 /news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 /news/canada/toronto/ford-teachers-unions-update-1.5429134 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-labour-action-1.5425586

Ford made the comments during a speech at a conference of rural municipal leaders in Toronto on Monday, two months ahead of the release of his second provincial spending package.  He repeatedly praised the leaders during remarks at the Rural Ontario Municipal Association event, saying his government values their feedback.  ""I've told the caucus and our ministers — no surprises,"" he said. ""No surprises to municipalities, just lay it on the line. Get their input. 'Cause again, I walked a mile in your shoes. I was a municipal councillor. [There was] nothing I hated more when the province would come up and say, 'Do this, do that.""'  The remarks strike a sharp contrast to the actions of his Progressive Conservative government, which slashed public health and child-care funding to municipalities during its first year in power.  The in-year cuts outraged civic leaders who said the moves were made without notice or consultation and fought back, forcing the government to backtrack on the changes months later.  Instead, the new cost-sharing arrangements were implemented at much lower levels on Jan. 1, and municipalities were offered transitional funding as they dealt with the changes.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/no-surprises-ontario-budget-ford-1.5433247,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-budget-2019-vic-fedeli-house-1.5092779 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-fall-economic-statement-setup-1.5348260,/news/canada/toronto/ontario-fall-economic-statement-setup-1.5348260 /news/canada/toronto/ontario-budget-2019-vic-fedeli-house-1.5092779

Vitalité Health Network has provided few details on his death and the internal investigation it sparked. ""I do see some signs of progress, but the reality is cultural change is difficult and takes time,"" said Charles Murray. ""Cases like this may demonstrate that there's a lot furthfer to go than we have gone so far.""  Murray, who is also the province's right to information and privacy commissioner, is investigating CBC's recent appeal to Vitalité Health Network.  CBC has been trying to obtain records regarding Michaud's death and Vitalité's internal investigation through the province's access to information system. Vitalité has only turned over an incident report and the text of two recommendations that were made. It said it doesn't have any more notes from its internal investigation.  The health authority initially refused to hand over any records concerning Michaud's death. Murray's investigation into CBC's appeal is expected to take a couple of weeks.  Although Murray can't comment on the ongoing investigation, he emphasised the importance of transparency.  Murray's 2019 report into the Restigouche facility, which was released two days before Michaud died, detailed a culture of silence and poor record keeping at the institution.  ""Without adequate notes, it becomes very difficult to ascertain what took place and to improve things,"" Murray told Information Morning Moncton. ""Mistakes happen in any system, but the ability to correct those mistakes starts with identifying those mistakes. Bad record keeping is the enemy of improvement.""  Vitalité initially cited patient confidentiality as one of the reasons why it would not release any information.  Although patient confidentiality is important, Murray said it should not be used to avoid releasing documents to the public.  ""We want to ensure that what's being done is truly protecting the interests of the patient or the patient's family in some cases, and not really a broad brush being used to avoid releasing documents,"" he said. ""That the agency or government would rather not [release documents] because they're embarrassing or they put it in a bad light.""  Michaud's family has said they would like to see more transparency from the health network.  ""My big frustration is after almost one year, we never had a letter or a phone call from the hospital or from Vitalité for condolences or something like that,"" said  Roland Michaud, Martin's father, in an interview with Radio-Canada. And there's nothing legally stopping Vitalité from issuing an apology to the Michaud family. ""Sometimes inside large agencies people feel like, 'Well it's not my place to do that. Someone above me should make that decision,'"" Murray said. ""But that sort of leadership has to come from the very top."" Politicians of all stripes have called on the government to be more transparent. Green Party Leader David Coon said he would like to see a public coroner's inquest into Michaud's death.  But Murray said it's up to the government to decide whether it wants to pursue an inquest. If an inquest were conducted more information may be brought to light, but another inquest also runs the risk of repeating information the ombud's office has already found.

NDP government that would have all but banned shipments of heavy oil through interprovincial pipelines.  ""Caring about our land and water and our economy, and the impacts of potential spills of not just bitumen but potentially other substances that the province wanted to regulate, is critically important,"" Eby said. ""We'll certainly be doing what we can within our jurisdiction to protect our economy and our environment."" The amendments would have required companies transporting these substances through B.C. to obtain provincial permits.  B.C. argued that, since the province would bear the brunt of damage from any spill, it should control what flows through the pipelines.  The court ruled, however, that provincial permits overstep the constitutional authority of Ottawa — essentially, that B.C. cannot enact legislation on a matter that falls under federal jurisdiction.  ""We haven't changed our view of the risks that this transport of heavy oil poses to British Columbians,"" said George Heyman, B.C.'s environment minister, in an interview Friday on CBC's The Early Edition. ""We are not trying to frustrate or play games. We are trying to do our job,"" added the minister. According to Heyman, the price tag to the province for pursuing the case in Supreme Court was about $1 million for outside legal counsel. Premier John Horgan had promised in the 2017 election campaign ""to use every tool in our tool box to stop"" the construction of the Trans Mountain expansion. But B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson says it's time for the B.C. NDP to get behind the project and accused the government of wasting time and money on court cases. ""The dismissal speaks for itself,"" he told Gloria Macarenko, host of CBC's On The Coast. ""When is this government going to learn that the government of British Columbia is subject to the laws of Canada?"" Wilkinson says taking the argument to the B.C. Court of Appeal cost taxpayers $1 million in legal fees in a ""futile gesture"" that was overturned five to zero.  ""[B.C.] then took that to the Supreme Court of Canada and lost nine-nothing with an immediate dismissal from the bench,"" said Wilkinson.  ""It's a humiliation for everybody involved.""  Sonia Furstenau, deputy leader of the B.C. Green Party and MLA for Cowichan Valley, argued that the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is, at the end of the day, a political minefield.    The last time there was significant public backlash against the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in 2018, thousands protested and about 150 people were arrested. In 2014, there were encampments on Burnaby Mountain and more than 100 people were arrested.  ""These are political decisions that are being made and a lot of people are not happy with these political decisions,"" Furstenau said.   ""In an era where we can see the impacts of climate change so vividly, to see governments doubling down on a fossil fuel-driven infrastructure, it makes no sense.""   A separate Federal Court of Appeals case on the project, which considers Indigenous issues, is still pending.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-reaction-supreme-court-trans-mountain-ruling-1.5430426,[],http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/no-phone-bill-telus-5000-1.5428591 /news/canada/british-columbia/hong-kong-social-housing-considers-expanding-to-vancouver-1.5407634 /news/canada/bc-special-prosecutor-autopsy-fifth-estate-1.5430387
283,Anonymous,2020-01-15T23:34:36.936Z,"Meghan's estranged father may testify against her, U.K. court documents show","The estranged father of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, could be called to testify against the royals in her lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday tabloid, court papers reveal. The prospect of a court battle is more bad news for Britain's Royal Family already shaken by Meghan and Prince Harry's decision to drop out of full-time royal duties. Meghan is suing the tabloid and its parent company, Associated Newspapers, for publishing a letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle. The civil lawsuit accuses the newspaper of copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating the United Kingdom's data protection law. Documents filed at the High Court in London show the newspaper plans to rely on evidence from Markle, stating that he ""had a weighty right to tell his version of what had happened between himself and his daughter, including the contents of the letter."" Papers drawn up by lawyers for the newspaper argue that members of the Royal Family ""generate and rely on publicity about themselves and their lives in order to maintain the privileged positions they hold and to promote themselves, their fulfilment of their duties and functions, and the good causes they have espoused."" ""There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the Royal Family and the activities, conduct and standards of behaviour of its members,"" the filing said. ""This extends not merely to their public conduct, but to their personal and family relationships because those are integral to the proper functioning of the monarchy."" The paper also argues that the letter's publication was in response to a ""one-sided"" article in People magazine in February 2019 featuring an interview with five unnamed ""close friends"" of the duchess that referenced the letter, meaning its existence was in the public domain. It also drew attention to the duchess's ""immaculate"" handwriting, which lawyers for the newspaper said was proof that she anticipated ""it being disclosed to and read by third parties."" Markle's strained relationship with his daughter has complicated Meghan's entry into the Royal Family. He had been due to walk Meghan down the aisle at her May 2018 wedding but pulled out at the last minute, citing heart problems. The former television lighting director has given occasional interviews to the media, complaining in December 2018 that he'd been ""ghosted"" by his daughter after the wedding. The documents came to light this week amid the firestorm of attention that followed Meghan and Prince Harry's announcement that they wanted to step back from their royal roles, become financially independent and split their time between Britain and North America. Queen Elizabeth convened a family summit on Monday at her Sandringham estate in eastern England and decided the couple could live part time in Canada. Meghan and Harry recently spent a six-week Christmas break on Vancouver Island, and Meghan lived in Toronto for several years while appearing in the TV show Suits. Meghan was seen in Canada for the first time since the crisis began when she visited the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre in Vancouver to discuss issues affecting women in one of the city's poorest neighbourhoods. The shelter posted a photograph of the duchess's visit this week. The revelation that Markle would be prepared to testify against his daughter raises the unseemly and potentially explosive possibility of a courtroom showdown in which Meghan faces cross-examination about her dealings with the media. Other royals, such as Harry, might be called as witnesses. Media attorney Mark Stephens told the BBC that the duchess would be forced to answer questions about how she might have tried to get her side of the story out to media outlets — however indirectly. The prospect of having her testify would send shivers through the Royal Family, as it would expose ""how the sausage of news is made,"" Stephens said. ""You really don't want to see how that's made, and you certainly would have to explain it in the witness box, and that's what Meghan is going to have to do,"" Stephens said. Analysts compared the case to the late Princess Diana's lawsuit over photographs showing her exercising on gym equipment. The case was settled before it was to be heard. Other royals, meanwhile, soldiered on Wednesday with their duties. Harry's older brother, William, and his wife, Kate, travelled to Bradford in northern England to speak with local business representatives and young people about their career prospects. Boxer Amir Khan, who met the couple on their visit to the city, urged the royals to ""sort things out amicably and sit down and resolve the situation because it's only going to get worse if you don't.""

Born Wade Douglas Bowles, Johnson was originally from Amherst. Johnson was a WWE Hall of Famer and former World Tag Team Champion, the WWE noted in its obituary. He made his pro wrestling debut in southern Ontario before rising to fame in the National Wrestling Alliance in the mid-1960s. He started in the WWE in 1983 with rivalries with the likes of Greg (The Hammer) Valentine, Don Muraco and Adrian Adonis. Eventually, he teamed with Tony Atlas as The Soul Patrol and the two men became the first black World Tag Team Champions in WWE history when they defeated The Wild Samoans on Dec. 10, 1983. After Johnson retired from wrestling in 1991, he helped train his son, The Rock — a nickname that was partly in tribute to his father. The younger Johnson went on to become the first-ever black WWE champion and then transitioned into a successful career as an actor. Rocky Johnson was inducted by his son into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2019, Rocky Johnson published a memoir called Soulman.  CBC News Nova Scotia at Six interviewed Johnson this past October to talk about the book and what it was like for him growing up in Amherst. He said his father died when he was 12 and that he ended up leaving home when he was 14 after getting into a fight with his mother's boyfriend. ""I hit him in the head with a coal shovel and then the police came and said one of them would have to go. I didn't understand because I was young. [My mom] said, 'You go,' and I just packed my suitcase,"" Johnson said. ""I was determined to do something, so I took off and went to Toronto."" When Johnson got to Toronto, he started boxing at Trinity Community Recreation Centre. However, it was a snowy and cold winter night that launched what would become his career in the wrestling ring. He was at the rec centre hitting a punching bag when he was approached by a wrestler. ""He said, 'Hey, come on in, I'll teach you a couple of holds.' I didn't know then he was using me for a punching bag.

285,Anonymous,2020-01-18T00:32:42.964Z,Why N.S. could seize insurance money given to man not criminally responsible for killing wife,"A law professor says the Nova Scotia government could seize life insurance money that a Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge granted to a Cape Breton man found not criminally responsible for killing his wife. Justice Frank Edwards ruled that Richard Maidment, 42, who also uses the surname McNeil, is entitled to his wife's life insurance, which totals $200,000 plus interest, according to court documents. Edwards, who released his decision this week, wrote that Maidment doesn't benefit from a crime because he didn't commit a crime and is not a criminal. In 2015, Sarabeth Forbes named Maidment as beneficiary to her life insurance and her son as a contingent.  Maidment has schizophrenia and his mental health had been deteriorating dramatically in the days before he killed Forbes on April 18, 2017, in their Gardiner Mines home. He was charged with first-degree murder and found not criminally responsible in December 2017. Maidment is now confined to the East Coast Forensic Hospital in Dartmouth, N.S. Forbes's co-workers and friends say they're sickened by the judge's decision, and believe the money belongs with her son. Jane Thomson, an assistant professor of law at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, said there's precedent for provincial governments to intervene in cases like this. She told CBC's Maritime Noon that under Nova Scotia's Civil Forfeiture Act, ""someone who is appointed by the attorney general can apply to the court for an order forfeiting the life insurance proceeds if they are the proceeds of unlawful activity."" She said ""unlawful activity"" encompasses actions for which a person has been found not criminally responsible. If the application is successful, the money would go to the provincial government, but Thomson said it could hold the money in trust for Forbes's son. He was 10 years old when his mother was killed. Thomson pointed to a case in Ontario from 2012 where a husband who killed his wife was found not criminally responsible, and was granted her $51,000 life insurance claim. In that case, Ontario's attorney general filed an application so the province would get the money instead, but in the end, a Superior Court judge quashed the province's attempt. Edwards cited part of the Dhingra vs Dhingra case in his decision to grant Maidment the insurance money. Thomson said the forfeiture law in Nova Scotia is very similar to the forfeiture law in Ontario.  She said it would be relatively straightforward for the province to file an application under the act, but cautioned the government against reacting too quickly. ""He was found not criminally responsible for a reason,"" Thomson said. ""It's a tragedy, but it was clearly at least found by this court not something that he could control."" The Department of Justice said it can't comment on this ""private legal matter that's currently before the courts,"" and that the Civil Forfeiture Act only allows for forfeiture to the province, and not to third parties. ""We understand this is a difficult situation for the community,"" spokesperson Barbara MacLean said in an email to CBC News.  MORE TOP STORIES",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/richard-maidment-life-insurance-wife-not-criminally-responsible-province-intervene-law-professor-1.5430963,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/highway-shut-down-blowing-snow-1.5430489 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/trade-deal-canada-lobster-sales-china-1.5431440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-capped-assessment-program-criticisms-1.5429579,[]

The whale was injured by a ship's propeller and it has been treated with antibiotics. ""The calf is responding to the injury like we would expect, to try to bridge and heal the injury itself,"" said Teri Rowles, a marine mammal health and stranding program co-ordinator with the administration.  ""But the prognosis still at this point remains poor."" Rowles said the calf was last seen on Wednesday, when antibiotics were administered via a large syringe, shot out of something similar to a dart gun. The calf was discovered earlier this month and was at the time the fourth North Atlantic right whale calf spotted this year. It was then that it was discovered the only days-old calf had a severe injury that NOAA officials said was ""consistent with the propeller of a vessel."" The right whale is an endangered species, with only about 400 individuals remaining. Fewer than 100 are adult females. Rowles said the calf is staying close to its mother. ""It rolls over the mother's back, it's staying very close, it dives under the mother,"" said Rowles.  ""We're hoping that means it's nursing, although we can't see underwater to confirm that. The calf's behaviour appears to be normal."" Rowles said NOAA wants to stress that prevention of these incidents is key to helping the dwindling right whale population. She said it's important for vessels to be cautious in areas that see increased whale activity, and to report any potential strikes as soon as they happen.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/prognosis-poor-whale-calf-1.5431859,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/north-atlantic-right-whale-calf-injured-propeller-1.5421256,/news/canada/new-brunswick/north-atlantic-right-whale-calf-injured-propeller-1.5421256

The 65-year-old ended up homeless, she says, after she was given two hours to pack what she could carry and get out of an apartment operated by a government-run mental health program. In March, according to Trask, staff sent her onto the street to fend for herself, handing her only a ""street survival guide"" to get by: a brochure that lists the locations of soup kitchens, 24-hour washrooms and homeless shelters. According to the eviction letter, Trask was kicked out of the mental health treatment facility after staff decided the program wasn't working for her, saying the senior was verbally aggressive and threatening toward staff. ""I mean my God, they think you're just human cattle,"" said Trask, who says she suffers from suicidal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe anxiety disorder. Trask had been in the live-in treatment program for a year. She was sent there from another facility in the Comox Valley, more than 200 kilometres northwest of Victoria, after that program underwent cutbacks, she said. The senior has no ID — it was stolen —and no family that can help. She often doesn't take the mood-stabilizing medications she needs.  She's been sleeping in homeless shelters and tents hidden in Victoria public parks since being evicted from the live-in treatment program last spring. While Vancouver Island Health's motto is, ""Excellent health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time,"" spokesperson Cheryl Bloxham told Go Public the health authority does discharge mentally ill people into emergency shelters ""as a last resort."" She said involuntary discharges are rare but that there is no database tracking exact numbers. Bloxham wouldn't comment on Trask's case, citing confidentiality rules, but said Island Health ensures those who are discharged and willing to participate in treatment programs continue to have access to mental health and substance-use services. Trask says she was willing to participate, even begged to stay. Trask is part of a broken system lacking housing and treatment facilities that can result in people with mental illness being put out onto the street, where their condition deteriorates, according to Jino Distasio, a researcher who has studied how to house people with mental health challenges. ""Dumping people onto the streets or into the shelter networks [is] everything we've been trying to undo over the last decade,"" he said. That adds pressure on overburdened emergency services across the country. Trask found an advocate in Carolina Tudela — a volunteer for a homeless drop-in centre — after she called in, asking for help dealing with rats that had entered her tent. ""It was overrun for sure. They were running all over her body when I found her,"" said Tudela.   Tudela picked Trask up and drove her around that June night, offering to pay for a hotel, but she couldn't get her a room because Trask had no identification. Trask ended up going back to her tent that night. ""What outrages me is the indifference and callousness,"" Tudela told Go Public. ""That somebody can just be kicked out of a program like that … with nowhere to go. Just 'Good luck.'"" In September,  police confiscated Trask's tent after finding it in a public park, leaving her to sleep on mats on the floors of homeless shelters or outdoors on church steps.  She says she was surrounded by violence. Now, she's back at a park in another tent belonging to another homeless person, hoping this one is hidden far enough from public view that it won't be confiscated. Tudela wrote to the provincial health authority and the B.C. government in August, asking them to help Trask. She says no one responded. Although the eviction letter said Trask had been verbally aggressive and threatening, her advocate says Trask is ""a very frail woman."" ""She's all about 110 pounds,"" Tudela said. ""She lives in constant fear she'll be kicked out of the tent she's got or that she's going to be raped at night. She lives in constant fear of harm."" Mental health experts estimate that 35,000 people are homeless in Canada on any given night — and of those, approximately 15 per cent suffer from mental illness. ""There's just no way in a country like Canada that we should have this many people on any given night struggling with shelter,"" said Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg. He says the reasons given for Trask's eviction are common challenges when treating people with certain mental health issues. He worked on one of the largest mental health services trials ever conducted in Canada, called At Home/Chez Soi (AHCS), and says leaving patients with no place to live and no access to treatment goes against the study's findings. The AHCS study he co-authored followed more than 2,000 participants for two years with test sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, N.B. It found that the most important requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing. The study, published Oct. 7, is considered the longest-running of its kind using the Housing First model, which is believed to significantly reduce homelessness over the long term. WATCH | Judy Trask shows housing advocate  Carolina Tudela her tent in a Victoria park: Without stable housing, Distasio says, patients' mental health deteriorates, putting more pressure on the emergency services everyone uses and pays for. ""Overuse of ERs, emergency services, police, fire, ambulance. It's a cascade of services and supports to address these individuals,"" Distasio told Go Public. Go Public put Trask's situation to Canada's first provincial minister of mental health and addictions, British Columbia's Judy Darcy, who admits the system is broken. ""For years, many people in B.C. have been struggling to navigate a fragmented and unco-ordinated mental health and addictions system of care,"" Darcy said in an email to Go Public. ""Our government is working to change this."" Darcy says the B.C. government plans to build 2,200 affordable housing units and expand access to mental health and addictions programs. Advocates say other provinces need to follow suit. As for Trask, she remains homeless. Tudela regularly checks on her friend and says she's worried about what might happen to her living on the street. ""You know the program is not working when you throw people out on the street. I mean, this is a senior citizen. Judy has mental health problems,"" says Tudela. ""The system is broken … I don't understand the coldness of it all.""

289,Anonymous,2020-01-19T13:30:00.998Z,When extremely cold weather was making news in Atlantic Canada in 1982,"Even in Canada, there comes a point where winter weather becomes newsworthy. Like when the temperature hits triple digits — below-zero digits. ""With the windchill, it was -100 degrees in Labrador City last night,"" The National's Knowlton Nash told viewers on Jan. 19, 1982. Nash said Labrador City had been hit with the worst blizzard in its history and the provincial government had declared it to be in a state of emergency. The storm prevented The National from transmitting any pictures from Labrador City, leaving reporter Kathryn Wright to describe the scene to viewers. ""Labrador City and Wabush has been bombarded with freezing temperatures and winds of more than 100 km/h,"" Wright told The National via telephone.  The powerful winds had knocked down trees, which in turn brought power lines down with them. That left many without power, including the 2,000 people living at a local trailer park that had to be evacuated by emergency crews. Wright said it was believed the storm could last another two days. Cold weather was also making news in Prince Edward Island, where the temperature had hit -30 C the previous day. As Brian Milburn reported on The National, that mercury drop was part of ""the coldest cold snap that anybody can remember,"" also saying the dip to -30 C was ""the lowest temperature on Prince Edward Island in 105 years."" And like in Labrador City, harsh winds were blowing snow all over island roads and highways. There were also power failures that left some Islanders in need of somewhere else to stay. Milburn said the snow was making it hard to reach some of the people who were stranded in rural areas. ""The Red Cross has been sending convoys of trucks led by snowplows to pick them up and take them to emergency accommodation,"" said Milburn. ""But even the plows are finding it tough going.""",https://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-extremely-cold-weather-was-making-news-in-atlantic-canada-in-1982-1.5426329,[],/archives/the-snowstorm-that-took-2-weeks-to-clean-up-in-p-e-i-1.5036021 /archives/when-brian-mulroney-wanted-canada-to-be-better-known-than-its-blizzards-1.5098461
290,Dan Taekema,2020-01-18T12:00:00.079Z,Rocky Johnson remembered by son as a wrestler who shattered racial barriers,"Curtis Bowles Johnson grew up among giants. As a child he watched his father, Rocky (Soul Man) Johnson, take on racism and smash through plenty of opponents during his decorated wrestling career. ""He shattered a lot of barriers, racial barriers,"" explained Bowles Johnson, adding he believes his father's legacy will echo for years to come even though the sound of the ring bell from his final match has long since faded. Johnson died on Wednesday. He was 75. The Nova Scotia-born wrestler, and father of movie star Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, started his journey to the ring here in Ontario. In the early 1960s Bowles Johnson says his father was driving a fish truck in Toronto and heading to Jack Wentworth's training school in Hamilton three or four times a week to learn to wrestle. ""He told me how much he enjoyed the training with the guys and how much he learned and how much he loved the city of Hamilton,"" said Bowles Johnson, who currently lives in the city. CBC spoke to him in October about plans to turn his father's life story into a movie. ""[Rocky] knew that he wanted to do something with his life, knew he wanted to box, or some kind of athletics,"" he explained. Hamilton was where his dad met a Canadian professional wrestler named ""Whipper"" Billy Watson and discovered a way he could embrace his full athletic potential beyond simply throwing punches. ""In wrestling you can do drop kicks, backflips … he liked that idea of being able to be more flexible, more athletic and move more,"" explained Bowles Johnson. Rocky Johnson was a natural, but the wins didn't come easy. On his way to becoming the first black champion in places like Georgia and Texas, Bowles Johnson said his father sometimes had to work with wrestlers who were racist. ""Wrestling is choreographed but some of the guys would stiff him — that means hit him for real with harder shots than should have been — just because of his race,"" he explained. But that wasn't enough to keep the Soul Man down. ""Once he realized who these guys were and what it was about then he'd hit back twice as hard ... just to let him know that's not going to happen,"" said Bowles Johnson. The men his father faced in the ring weren't his only opponents, he added. ""There were times when promoters wanted you to do the jive or the 'black thing' and my dad would tell them 'No, I'm an athlete. I'm not going to act a certain way to please you.'"" Bowles Johnson said his dad always handled himself with grace and wanted to leave a legacy as not just a good black wrestler, but a great athlete period. Eventually, he teamed with Tony Atlas as The Soul Patrol and the two men became the first black World Tag Team Champions in WWE history when they defeated The Wild Samoans on Dec. 10, 1983. Johnson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008. He was ""proud of shattering barriers and making it easier for the other black wrestlers to come behind him,"" said his son. Today Bowles Johnson stands six foot five inches tall and weighs about 250 pounds, but growing up he was surrounded by titans of the wrestling world, from Abdullah the Butcher to André the Giant. ""Being a little guy, these guys were giants … heroes, idols to me growing up,"" he recalled, adding to this day he's tough to impress when it comes to commenting on the physique of other guys working out at the gym. ""Huge to me was André the Giant … or my dad. That was huge,"" said Bowles Johnson. ""You see things in a different perspective when you … grow up with larger than life figures."" He thinks of his father as someone who was incredibly determined, grounded and always found a way to do the right thing. ""I've seen him work hard all his life,"" said Bowles Johnson. ""I've seen him held down at certain times until he had to work twice as hard because of racial barriers."" When he looks at wrestling today, Johnson said he sees evidence his father's fight wasn't in vain. ""Like any sport it evolves. Guys of yesterday paved the road so it can be like today.,"" he explained. ""They endured the hardships and went through all that … so it could be what it is today."" To Bowles Johnson, his father was more than a wrestling icon. ""It's funny because through all the fame and all the titles ... he was always just dad to me.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/rocky-johnson-curtis-bowles-johnson-1.5429494,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/wwe-reports-n-s-born-wrestler-rocky-johnson-has-died-1.5428604 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5429469/rocky-johnson-was-a-champion-for-black-equality-says-tag-team-partner-tony-atlas-1.5429480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rocky-johnson-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-memoir-wrestler-amherst-1.5326842,/news/canada/nova-scotia/wrestler-rocky-johnson-dwight-johnson-film-1.4813130
291,Anonymous,2019-12-20T17:00:00.792Z,"I worked hard to raise a feminist daughter, but her racy online selfies make me feel I failed","This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage. For more information, please read our FAQ.   To some, ""feminist"" is a label that every empowered woman and progressive man should wear proudly. It is not controversial — it stands for the idea that every woman is a complete human being. Women are not less than men. Women deserve equal pay, equal say and equal rights in any society.  To others, ""feminist"" is a problematic term because of the biases and expectations that accompany it. Within the world of women, a feminist can be rejected as such for not following certain rules or can find herself scrutinized for failing the movement — because a feminist is expected to look a certain way, speak a certain way and live a certain way. Here are two conflicting views of what feminism means today, as told in this point-counterpoint by one Montreal mother and her teenage daughter.  I don't think expecting my daughter not to post sexed-up selfies amounts to 'slut-shaming': Jennifer Morrow Last summer, I stumbled onto my teenage daughter's social media account. What I found confirmed my worst fear: I had failed to raise a feminist.  There, among the pouty-faced selfies, was a photo of her posing, Sports Illustrated-style, on a jet ski in her bikini, brandishing her middle finger at the camera with a smirk on her face. My heart sank.  ""Who is this person?"" I asked myself. All her life, I've tried to model feminism: taking her on marches for women's rights, reading to her from books like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's We Should all be Feminists and surrounding her with a community of strong, independent female friends.  I realize now that the wisdom of my mother's ""Women's Lib"" generation doesn't cover the challenges of raising a feminist daughter in the 21st century.  Indeed, most young women seem so put off by the identity politics that come with calling themselves feminists that they're rejecting the label altogether.  ""What's the big deal?"" Clara asked me when I confronted her about the offending photo. ""It's just a picture."" Where do I start?  As I write this, 14 beacons of light are shining in the night sky over Montreal, in memory of the women killed in the Polytechnique shooting.  They are stark reminders that our daughters are still vulnerable to violent men who will do whatever it takes to keep women silent and subservient.  Feminism seeks to create a new world where that isn't the reality they face.  My daughter believes a photo of herself sitting on a jet ski in her bikini represents girl power. But it actually just looks like the media has poisoned that message entirely and used it to perpetuate the status quo.  We want our girls to grow up brave, confident and assertive.  But they are drip-fed gender-conforming, sexualized images to the point where they think it's perfectly normal to strive to meet male-defined expectations of them — the more performative and sexy the better.  What is the point of these images? The question answers itself, and I find the porny subtext deeply disturbing.  Girls like my daughter can afford to be ambivalent about feminism. They live in a society that is relatively safe for girls, especially if they are privileged and white. As far as she is concerned, my pontificating about the need to fight gender stereotypes is just an old-fashioned demand to cover up her body — also known as slut-shaming. What is a mother to do? Ever since I first held her in my arms, all I wanted was for her to be happy and safe. This thing called feminism is a complicated gift.  One day, when she's out of the house and I can't hold her daily, I hope she will unwrap this complicated gift and find what she needs inside — the tools to navigate an even more complicated world while staying true to herself. 'Would a boy be punished for looking too sexy?' asks Clara Morrow-Coffrant When my mother confronted me with the pictures on my Instagram, I thought ""What's the issue? It's not that big a deal.""  I told her that everyone posts photos like this. Also, it's not like this is anything new to our society. For example, Barbie is a hypersexualized children's toy that is given to girls as a sort of role model. Yes, she now comes in more shapes and colours, but we still think of her as having a perfect body and perfect blond hair. My mother thinks I'm too young to be putting this sort of image online, but I am not ashamed of it. What I, as a young woman of 15, post on social media doesn't define me. It is not the whole of who I am.  Am I a feminist? I don't know. The fact is that feminism today is much too difficult to define because everybody has a different perspective on what it means.  Of course, I believe in equality, but you are putting all the burden on me to police my self-expression in the interest of feminism — something I don't completely understand and can't get a real definition of.  Would a boy sitting on a jet ski be punished for looking too sexy?  Anyway, statistics show that my personal safety doesn't depend on what I wear. I also think that people are much too quick to judge a girl based on how she looks. You can judge me if you want to, I really don't care. My posts are for me and my friends. They are meant to be funny and ironic. It's not that deep. It's not political.  Instagram is just for fun. I'm still young, and I am allowed to make a few mistakes as I figure out who I want to be. This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage.

292,Paul Tukker,2020-01-16T16:17:13.549Z,"As rescue costs soar, Parks Canada sets new rules for climbing Canada's highest peak","Parks Canada has announced new rules for climbers attempting to tackle Canada's highest peak, after it had to perform several dangerous and expensive rescue missions in recent years. There's now a moratorium on solo climbing on Mount Logan, as well as winter expeditions on the mountain or anywhere else in Yukon's Kluane National Park. Climbers are also now required to have insurance to cover search-and-rescue costs. ""We really wanted to improve the safety both for folks visiting Kluane as well as the safety for our rescue responders,"" said Ed Jager, with Parks Canada. ""We've also taken all three of these steps to reduce the financial burden on taxpayers for the rescues that have been taking place in Kluane."" According to Jager, there have been eight rescue missions in Kluane in the last seven years. Each typically costs about $60,000 to $100,000 — and Canadian taxpayers have been footing the bill. ""The normal practice in Parks Canada, and across the entire system, has been the rescue was part of the services that we provided to all of our visitors,"" he said. That practice was starting to make less sense in Kluane, where it's easier for people to get into trouble and harder to get them out.  Mount Logan and the icefield ranges in Kluane National Park are remote, forbidding — and increasingly popular. According to Jager, about 35 groups, or roughly 100 people, head out each year on expeditions into the park. About a third of them go to tackle Mount Logan, which is 5,959 metres high. Two years ago, a Quebec woman made headlines by becoming the first woman to summit Mount Logan in a solo trek — only to call for a rescue on her way back down. And the year before, an Argentine climber found herself stranded on the mountain after a large earthquake. She waited four days at high altitude before a high-risk rescue.    Other rescues receive less publicity, but the costs and risks are similar. Jager describes the new rules as a work in progress.  ""We want to make sure that the tools we've put in place are going to work effectively,"" he said. ""And you know, my assumption is that we'll be adjusting them and making them work best for both Parks Canada, and our visitors.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/new-rules-climbers-mount-logan-kluane-1.5428705,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/natalia-martinez-survival-mountain-1.4103171 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/high-altitude-rescue-helicopter-yukon-kluane-1.5108365,/news/canada/north/richard-mount-logan-rescue-1.4690895 /news/canada/north/climbers-mount-wood-marceau-yukon-1.5058595 /news/canada/british-columbia/naomi-prohaska-mount-logan-youngest-ever-1.4145075 /news/canada/north/record-year-mount-logan-1.4463374
293,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:32:41.092Z,Gay pastor forced out of Lutheran Church in the '80s becomes 1st to be reinstated,"Becoming the new pastor at the First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Toronto was like coming home for Ralph Carl Wushke.  The 66-year-old pastor was first ordained into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) in 1978, but was forced to leave in the '80s after coming out as a gay man.  But on Saturday, in front of a packed crowd of supportive congregates, he was officially reinstated.  ""It was really the culmination of a lifelong dream for me,"" Wushke told As It Happens host Carol Off. ""I was received back with great joy."" Wushke is the first pastor to be welcomed back to the church since it changed its rules to allow for LGBTQ clergy in 2011, the ELCIC says.  ""I see it as an important step in our commitment to full inclusion of the LGBTQ2SIA+ community within our church and for equal rights and justice within the whole of society,"" Rev. Susan C. Johnson, the ELCIC's national bishop, said in an emailed statement.  Wushke says he's known since he was a boy that he wanted to be a Lutheran pastor.  ""I think I've always known,"" he said. ""As my mother would tell you, when I was six years old, I lined up my two younger brothers on the steps in our house and started preaching to them and insisting that they say, 'Amen' at the end of my prayers."" But as he went through his seminary studies, he says he became increasingly aware of his sexual orientation and worried how it would affect his career. ""Indeed, the night of my ordination was one of the biggest windstorms we've ever had,"" he said.""I thought, 'Oh, this is just an omen for the storms to come.'"" In 1984, Wushke decided he could no longer hide who he was. ""This was something that I had to do, not only for the sake of theological integrity, but also because of my own mental and emotional and spiritual health,"" he said. ""What is the cost of discipleship? What is the cross that I'm supposed to bear? Is it to stay in the closet, or is it to come out and pay the price of being truthful honest and authentic? I chose the latter, and I've never regretted it."" Wushke left his parish in Wapella, Sask., without giving a reason, he said, hoping to save the small Prairie community from scandal. He moved to Ottawa and pursued other career paths. But he says he still felt the call. A few years later, he reached out to ELCIC to ask if he could be placed in a new parish — one that would recognize and accept him as a gay man.  ""One by one, the bishops just said, like, this is not possible really. I mean, unless you're going to commit to celibacy, you know, we couldn't even consider this."" The church then backed up its decision in writing. In 1988, the bishops issued a statement that ""self-declared and practising homosexuals"" could not be ordained as pastors, and those who were already ordained would not be permitted to head up a parish. That statement was ratified the following year as official church policy at the national level. ""It was quite painful,"" Wushke said. ""The Lutheran Church in Canada is quite small, and all of the bishops were also personal friends."" That policy remained in place until 2011. By then, Wushke had moved on, becoming a priest with the LGBTQ-inclusive United Church of Canada. He retired in 2018. But a part of him always wanted to return to the Lutheran Church, he said. ""I imagined it a lot over the years,"" he said. ""I never knew if it really would happen."" Last year, the Lutheran Church created a process specifically designed to fast-track the reinstatement of LGBTQ clergy who were forced out. The timing was perfect for Wushke. He had just recovered from open-heart surgery and was feeling like he had a new lease on life. So when the opportunity to join First Evangelical Lutheran came up, he seized it.  ""I feel like a young man again and had all this energy for ministry,"" he said. The process of coming back has been emotional, he said, and an excellent first step. But he says there's more work to be done — and he's eager to do it. ""I'll try to serve faithfully. Our congregation is in the heart of the city, surrounded by Ryerson University. There are no end of possibilities. There is a safe-injection site around the corner. There's poverty,"" he said.  ""The general public, I think, mostly associates the church with that kind of church that is rejecting, that is judgmental, that isn't warm and welcoming. So we have a task to say the church is a complex place ... and, I mean, just dispelling the perceptions of the church as a very negative, hostile institution is a big job in itself.""

Licences for Nova Scotia doctors expire each year on Dec. 31 and the annual fee is $1,950. Ikede incurred a late fee of $487 for paying his fee after Nov. 30, but before the end of the year. ""I said, 'How can I be late on something that hasn't expired yet?' And they said, 'Well, that's our policy as long as you don't meet our renewal window,'"" he said. Ikede compared it to home or auto insurance, and said it would be unacceptable to charge late fees early. It's up to each province's medical college to set rates and renewal rules. In New Brunswick, a licence is $600, but the late fee is $200. Ontario also charges a 25 per cent late fee, but that kicks in after the licence expires. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only other jurisdiction that charges a late fee before a licence expires. Ikede admits he was repeatedly warned by email that his fees were due. He's been licensed in the province since 2010 and never missed the deadline before. ""Imagine if you got an email the first week of November knowing that your licence is good till the end of the year,"" he said. ""That's not going to be on the top of your priority list of the other 150 emails you get that day."" Ikede isn't alone. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia said about 100 other physicians were issued a late fee this year. It said the late fees add a layer of protection for patients. ""Our legislation requires that a physician's licence is suspended if not renewed by year end,"" it said in a statement. ""When this happens, the first week of January may have cancelled surgeries or closed clinics or emergency departments."" Last year, more than 500 physicians renewed on the last day before the late fee took effect, the college said, while the remaining 100 were charged the $487 fee. ""These 100 physicians would have had their licences suspended by force of law, and patient care would have been interrupted dramatically,"" the statement read. Ikede said he understands the necessity for deadlines, but said the 25 per cent fine is extreme. He said it took five minutes to renew his licence online. ""The college is getting almost $50,000 every year just from late fees collected in the month of December,"" he said. ""That seems like a lot of money to me to be collecting and when you consider that the removal process is pretty much automated."" Ikede said he's so frustrated that he plans to stop renewing his licence in Nova Scotia. The college said it will waive Ikede's late fee and review the ways it communicates with physicians in the future.

296,Haydn Watters,2020-01-20T01:25:42.660Z,"As final Zellers stores close, former employees swap memories, memorabilia","Zellers is pulling the plug on its final two stores in Ontario this month, but Richard Hall doesn't want it to die. He's rounded up a museum-worthy haul of Zellers memorabilia in his dining room, spilling into his kitchen. There's flashy branded buttons, bathroom key chains, even a fire extinguisher from one of the doomed department stores.  His wife calls it hoarding. He calls it collecting. Hall spent 35 years employed by Zellers, working at 11 different stores. Today, he relies on his memorabilia to reminisce. ""Every segment of my life, I think back of what store I was in,"" he said. ""It's weird but it's kind of a measurement of time."" The last two Zellers locations in Etobicoke, Ont., and Ottawa will close on Jan. 26, according to Hudson's Bay Co., the retailer's parent company. Hall's memorabilia spans his entire dining room. He's got signed hockey sticks, limited edition bottles of Hudson's Bay Co. scotches, multiple copies of the same Zellers flyers — all in mint condition.  And this is after he purged the collection. Perhaps his most prized possession is a gift he was given: A framed copy of a newspaper from 1945, just after the Second World War ended, containing an ad from the original Zellers location in London, Ont. The page celebrates the ""glorious day of victory,"" while also being dominated by a lengthy spread on Adolf Hitler's ""mad career,"" complete with swastika imagery. ""This isn't about Hitler. This is about the Zellers,"" he assures. ""I point that out to everyone that I show: I say, 'No, I'm not a Hitler fan. I'm a Zellers fan.'"" Hall started at Zellers when he was 15, working his way up to general manager of marketing, where he ended his career in 2013. That's when most Zellers were closing down or converting to now-defunct Canadian Target locations. Along the way, he met his wife. She was working at another department store, Towers, when Zellers took it over. ""I was asked to take the assistant manager from Towers under my wing, and so I did. And we've been married 28 years,"" he said. ""I took the instructions literally."" Maria Hall remembers how Richard relentlessly tried to woo her. She worked at Store No. 64, so he sent her 64 balloons, 64 roses — and then a limo to the store. ""Isn't that crazy? The store was like, 'What is going on, Maria? Like, what is going on with this guy?',"" she recalled.​​ Zellers stores, she said, started many relationships. When Target came in, Richard and Maria Hall both lost their jobs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Richard kept the letter employees received when Zellers made the announcement that the U.S. retailer was taking over. Target spent about $1.8 billion acquiring leases for 189 Zellers locations across Canada in 2011, though the move north of the border turned out to be a disaster: The last Canadian Target store closed its doors in 2015 and the company lost billions. ""Our lives are much better and it was a good thing,"" Hall said of losing his job. ""It was a catalyst to go do something different after being in the same company for so long."" A handful of Zellers stores remained open, ultimately outlasting Target. That includes the Etobicoke location, in Toronto's west end, which has seen hours-long lineups over the past few weeks, with shoppers snaking around the store, hungry for sales. The final two locations are a bit different than other, traditional Zellers that Canadians may remember, Hall said. They instead liquidate the Bay's leftover inventory. But the closing at the end of the month still means the Zellers name will be officially gone. ""I think only us employees that have worked there can actually understand that, 'cause it's hard to articulate how important it was to people,"" he said. Many people are active on a Facebook group called ""If you ever worked for Zellers,"" where store and corporate employees from around the country reminisce. News of the last two closings has spurred a flurry of memories. The group was started in 2013 by Brenda Scott, who worked at a Zellers store in Huntsville, in Ontario's Muskoka region. She wanted a way to stay in touch with colleagues as the stores were first closing and said the group has filled that void. More than 4,500 employees have joined her group since. ""You work for a Zellers, it's like working for family,"" she said. Scott, who now lives in Barrie, Ont., travelled down to the Etobicoke location earlier this month, wanting to say goodbye to the chain. She watched as crowds lined up in front of the store, waiting to get in before it had even opened. She said it made her feel upset — and longing for a Canadian company to shop at. ""I'm pretty sure Walter [P. Zeller] is looking down, watching everybody, and saying, 'This isn't necessary,'"" she said.  ""It's the end of an era. It really is. Being the end of an era makes a lot of people who worked there sad.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/zellers-closing-memorabilia-1.5425471,[],/news/canada/toronto/zellers-final-weeks-toronto-1.5418276 /news/canada/ottawa/zellers-bells-corners-closing-hudson-s-bay-business-1.5415919

The Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program (OSDCP) allows low-income seniors to visit a dentist for free, but the paperwork and few approved dentists mean there's a lengthy wait. The program was announced in June 2019 but only launched the application system at the end of November. For Rogers Villeford, he's already spent six months with bleeding gums — and just last week another filling fell out.  ""I've had this for about six months ... every day I bleed,"" said Villeford. ""I take mouthwash and keep it in there awhile and swish it ... every morning I spit out blood.""  Villeford's income is about $18,000 a year. He was accepted into the OSDCP, but the appointment he was given is nearly two months away.  ""What good are [the dentists] if you have to wait?"" said Villeford. Locally the OSDCP is run by the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit. According to the director of health promotion, dentists under the program started seeing patients two weeks ago.  ""Our first senior seen under the program was Jan. 6,"" said Nicole Dupuis.  Dupuis said so far the program has seen about 15 patients, with another 46 appointments already booked. Appointment bookings are as far away as March. According to Dupuis it takes about one month between filling out the application to receiving a card that gives you access to the program. After the card comes in, seniors can book an appointment — but the first appointment is typically just a consultation.  ""We'll have more appointment times going forward,"" said Dupuis. ""We have had a wait list in our clinics ... a month is actually not too bad. We hope it won't get too much longer beyond that time frame."" Villeford decided he can't wait that long, so he made an appointment with a dentist — but he'll have to pay out of pocket for his treatment.  ""I don't want to lose my two front teeth,"" said Villeford, who expects to spend about $500 on the visit. ""It's a sham."" Similar to the Healthy Smiles Ontario program, there is an emergency service that might be available for people who need immediate treatment. To get emergency dental care, seniors would have to fill out a form signed by their medical provider that states they need treatment right away.  Villeford said the WECHU gave him an emergency appointment for Tuesday, but it won't include any work like fillings. Instead it will be to address what the health unit might consider are more serious problems.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/seniors-dental-program-ontario-windsor-teeth-1.5433138,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-government-regular-dental-care-seniors-1.5366082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/senior-dental-program-windsor-essex-1.5134955 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/windsor-essex-health-unit-budget-2020-lean-1.5347818 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/dental-problems-out-of-emergency-rooms-more-funding-ontario-dental-association-1.5002474,/news/canada/windsor/dental-problems-out-of-emergency-rooms-more-funding-ontario-dental-association-1.5002474 /news/canada/windsor/senior-dental-program-windsor-essex-1.5134955 /news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-government-regular-dental-care-seniors-1.5366082

Born in Brockville, Ont., DeBlois is the writer, director, and executive producer of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. The third instalment of the trilogy has been nominated for an Oscar for best animated feature. The DreamWorks Animation film stars Montreal's Jay Baruchel as a now grown-up Viking named Hiccup, who embarks on yet another adventure with his dragon, Toothless. The star-studded cast includes the voices of Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera and Jonah Hill. The villain Grimmel is voiced by F. Murray Abraham. This isn't DeBlois's first rodeo, nor his first Oscar nod. He was also nominated for each of the first two instalments of How to Train Your Dragon, and he co-wrote and co-directed the Oscar-nominated Disney film Lilo and Stitch in 2002. So far, he hasn't brought home the hardware. ""I kind of know the drill a little bit, and I also know the disappointment of losing, so it's a measured excitement,"" DeBlois told CBC's Ottawa Morning. ""These next couple of weeks will be a lot of fun. For a while, we all get to be winners, and then the inevitable night comes where four out the five of us will go home empty handed."" DeBlois, whose father was a butcher, recalls having a steady supply of paper to doodle on in his childhood in western Gatineau's community of Aylmer. ""He would bring home these rolls of butcher paper which hung in a closet beneath the stairs, and I would just pull out sheets of it and draw all over. I was encouraged from an early start by my parents."" As he developed his skill, DuBlois said his main inspiration was a cartoon barbarian. ""I learned to draw from studying Conan. The anatomy was so ripped."" DeBlois studied animation at a summer program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. During the rest of the year, he worked at Ottawa's now-defunct Hinton Animation Studios, honing his craft on the TV show The Raccoons.  He moved to Ireland in 1990 to work as a story board assistant on A Troll in Central Park and Thumbelina, then got his big break in 1994, when he moved to California for a job with Disney Feature Animation in Burbank. DeBlois said he's taken his mother to every Academy Awards ceremony he's attended. ""She thinks it's just amazing to be walking the red carpet and walking up to people like Meryl Streep and introducing herself. It's a lot of fun to see it through her eyes.""

Government data Friday showed growth was down from 2018's 6.6 per cent, already the lowest since 1990. Economic growth in the three months ending in December held steady at the previous quarter's level of six per cent. Chinese exporters have been battered by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes in a fight over Beijing's technology ambitions and trade surplus, though the overall impact on China's economy has been smaller than some forecasters expected. The economy faces ""downward pressure"" and ""instability sources and risk points"" abroad are increasing, the government said in a statement. The head of the country's statistics bureau said China will maintain a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy in 2020 and roll out more support measures this year. China does not deliberately pursue high economic growth and it is normal for gross domestic product (GDP) growth to fluctuate, Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, told a news conference in Beijing following the release of the economic data.  Negotiators this week signed an interim trade deal under which Washington agreed to cancel additional planned tariff hikes and Beijing committed to buy more American farm exports. Tariff hikes already imposed by both sides remained in place. Economic growth for 2019 was at the low end of the ruling Communist Party's official target of six to 6.5 per cent. The party is trying to steer China to slower, more manageable growth but an abrupt downturn in activity and the clash with Washington have forced the ruling party to step up government spending and take other measures to support growth. Growth in retail spending, which Chinese leaders are trying to nurture in order to reduce reliance on trade, decelerated to eight per cent over a year earlier, down from 8.2 per cent in the first three quarters.

303,Amy Smart,2020-01-21T01:12:48.700Z,"B.C., Alta. Indigenous leaders call on federal government to kill Teck Frontier mine project","Indigenous leaders from British Columbia and Alberta who oppose Teck's Frontier mine say its impact will be felt by First Nations well beyond the site of the massive oilsands project. Members of Indigenous Climate Action, the Tiny House Warriors and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs were among those who gathered Monday in North Vancouver outside the office of Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson calling on him to stop the project. The Teck Frontier mine north of Fort McMurray, Alta., would produce 260,000 barrels of oil a day and about four million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year, for more than 40 years. The federal government must make a decision on the project by the end of February under the Environmental Assessment Act. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has called for swift approval of the $20.6-billion project, warning that rejection would send a signal that Canada's oil-and-gas sector has no future, but the mine also poses a significant obstacle toward the Liberals' goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs called the project irresponsible and reckless, saying Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should ""walk the walk"" of transitioning to a green economy. ""There were commitments made during the last election that the Trudeau government would make decisive moves toward renewable energy and this is an opportunity to follow through on those promises,"" he said. Indigenous Leaders and activists deliver an open letter to the office of Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Jonathan Wilkinson, calling on Minister Wilkinson to Reject the Teck Frontier Mine <a href=""https://t.co/oNuHYYcfER"">pic.twitter.com/oNuHYYcfER</a> Teck Resources Ltd. said in a statement that it has spent more than a decade on community engagement, including signing agreements with all 14 Indigenous communities in the project area. The agreements set out a framework for co-operation in areas like environmental stewardship and economic opportunities, it said. ""Teck is committed to developing the Frontier Project in a way that is environmentally responsible, respectful of Indigenous communities, and creates meaningful benefits for the people of the region,"" it said. Kanahus Manuel of the Tiny House Warriors and Secwepemc Nation said product from the Frontier mine would be transported via the Trans Mountain pipeline, which crosses 518 kilometres of Secwepemc territory. ""This Teck mine will impact our community although it's hundreds of miles away,"" she said. Wilkinson was not available for an interview but his department said in a statement that the project is under active consideration. ""The government will consider a range of factors when they make a decision, including our commitments to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, to creating good paying middle-class jobs, and to growing the economy,"" the statement said. A joint review panel submitted its report in July containing its conclusions and recommendations for the Teck Frontier project to the minister and the chief executive officer of the Alberta Energy Regulator. The panel determined Frontier would be in the public interest, even though it would likely cause harm to the environment and Indigenous people. It's expected to create $12 billion in tax revenues for Ottawa and $55 billion in tax and royalty revenues for Alberta over its 41-year life. About 7,000 jobs would be created in building the mine and 2,500 workers would be needed to operate it. Chief Gerry Cheezie of Smith's Landing First Nation, a community in northern Alberta that has not signed an agreement and is downstream from the project, said he has seen significant environmental decline in his lifetime. He said he can no longer fish or drink the water directly from Slave River and has watched moose, migratory birds and other species disappear or decline.

304,Fred Youngs,2019-12-19T22:03:50.448Z,Why Alberta isn't treated more like Quebec,"This column is an opinion from Fred Youngs, a former journalist for CBC News in Winnipeg, Calgary and Toronto. He was senior producer and executive producer for CBC Newsworld (now CBC News Network) in Calgary from 1991 until 2006. As meetings of minds go, the result of the gab session between Premier Jason Kenney and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could hardly be called either dramatic or decisive. But it did show that, at least for now, the two politicians can play in the same sandbox without creating a ruckus. If that counts as progress, frustrated and fearful Albertans might well wonder why it took being wiped off the electoral map in Alberta and Saskatchewan for their plight to work its way to the top of the federal government's agenda. Why, in short, did it take so long to get the prime minister's ear?  And that leads to another question, one that Albertans often raise on social media and in commentary. OPINION | Kenney goes to Ottawa seeking gold, returns with participation medal It seems that many of them think the response from Ottawa would have been much, much stronger and would have come much, much faster if Quebec had to grapple with problems similar to Alberta's. What, they might ask, would Ottawa do if one in every five Quebec men under 25 was unemployed? How would Ottawa respond if a similarly deep and prolonged economic downturn had happened in Quebec?  The answer may well lie in voting patterns in Quebec and Alberta. Quebec voters are reliably unreliable. They may love you this election and forsake you in the next. So politicians have to work diligently to woo them over, and that effort goes on before the campaign starts, and continues after it has ended. Federal politicians never take Quebec voters for granted. Albertans are exactly the opposite. If, as the idiom goes, death and taxes are the only certainties in life, a close third is how Albertans vote: reliably, proudly and almost universally Conservative or, if you prefer, conservative. Thus Alberta is fly-over country for the most part in federal election campaigns, and not just for the Liberals. The Conservatives aren't going to spend time, energy and money on votes they know are in the bag. In every federal election since 1984, Alberta has voted overwhelmingly for some variation of a conservative party — the Progressive Conservatives, Reform, Canadian Alliance, and the Conservatives under Stephen Harper and this year Andrew Scheer. Oh sure, there were occasional drifts in a riding here or there, where a Liberal or NDP candidate would win. But for any political party that isn't blue, Alberta is pretty much a wasteland. This last election wasn't the first time that the Liberals had been shut out in the province, and it likely won't be the last. Quebec, in that same period, has been a veritable land of opportunity for federal parties. It swung hard to the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney, abandoned them under Kim Campbell, alarmed the rest of the country by sending the Bloc Québécois to Ottawa in three successive elections, surprised the NDP with 58 seats in 2011, and were all-in for the Trudeau Liberals in 2015.  It's no mystery that the Liberals would worry more about how something plays in Quebec than they would worry about Alberta. It helps explain the all-hands-on deck attempt to squelch charges facing SNC-Lavalin — an effort on behalf of a single company that cost Trudeau two of his highest-profile female cabinet ministers, and was a factor in the Liberals losing their majority. Even Stephen Harper, who forged a majority government with just six seats in Quebec, kept a wary eye on that province. He short-circuited a Bloc Québécois plan by introducing a motion that would recognize Quebec as a nation within Canada. Then he made sure there would be no mixed message to Quebecers by ordering his caucus to vote in favour of it or be expelled. Some Conservative MPs had deep reservations, and six — all from Western Canada — were absent for the vote.  Whether it is Conservative or Liberal, Ottawa has long used federal largesse to remind Quebec voters who's got their back. In November 2018, the Liberals split billions of dollars in maintenance work between Davie shipyard in Lévis, Que., and Irving Shipbuilding in Halifax. An irritated Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeill — a Liberal — accused his federal counterparts of changing the procurement process to allow Davie to get a piece of the pie.  Montreal-based Bombardier always seems to be at some crossroads that requires it to ask for financial support from Ottawa and/or Quebec City. The Montreal Economic Institute think tank estimates the company has received $4 billion from various governments since 1966. That's some serious wooing. Compare that to what the federal government eventually offered to Alberta: a $1.6 billion aid package for the energy sector that was mostly in the form of loans. It was widely panned in the province, even by erstwhile ally and then premier, Rachel Notley. Then there is Bill 21, the Quebec law that bans some civil servants from wearing religious symbols (read hijabs and turbans) while on the job. Politicians of all stripes have contorted themselves into human pretzels trying to say something that means nothing about the legislation, lest they get offside with Quebec voters who overwhelmingly support the bill.  Party leaders were roundly criticized for that weak-kneed response, but they aren't going to go too far out on a limb for fear of riling Quebec voters. One can only assume that if Doug Ford had brought in similar legislation, the reaction would have been different. In the end, there is no right or wrong way to vote. People cast their ballots for all sorts of different and personal reasons that range from social or economic issues to family traditions to disliking a party leader because of something his father once did.  Quebec voters' willingness to make politicians earn their votes has worked for them. But no one should expect that Albertans are going to water down their fealty to all things Conservative just so they can get the attention of Ottawa.  At the same time though, if politicians of every stripe know what to expect from Albertans, then Albertans shouldn't expect those fly-over federal leaders to expend a lot of effort — or a lot of money — trying to woo them anytime soon either.  That's just the cost of being true blue.

305,Mark Gollom,2020-01-20T12:17:05.841Z,Prince Harry might be looking for a job when he comes to Canada. Here are some options,"With the announcement on Saturday that Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer be working members of the Royal Family — and therefore no longer receiving money from the public purse — the couple may be looking for work when they eventually arrive in Canada. While Meghan Markle could go back to being an actor — she recently signed a deal with Disney for voiceovers — Harry has spent time in the military, having served two tours in Afghanistan, but he hasn't really forged a career. B.C. Premier John Horgan has already joked if they end up in his province, ""I'm sure I could  find something for Harry to do."" However, there are some restrictions, said Andrew Heard, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University whose research has specialized in Canadian constitutional issues and the Crown. One of the main restrictions on both of them is that they cannot be in a position where there is a reasonable perception that they, or any potential employers, might be taking advantage of the royal connection, Heard said. ""Even if they step back from most formal events, they will still remain members of the Royal Family and any future careers cannot appear to trade on that prestigious connection or imply privileged access to political and business elites."" WATCH: Prince Harry saddened to step back, but wants 'more peaceful life' Other royals have taken on private sector jobs, although not always with successful results. Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth, launched a TV production firm in 1993 that failed in 2011 after years of mediocre performance.  His wife, Sophie, tried to keep her established public relations firm going after she married Edward in 1999, but she was embarrassed two years later by an undercover reporter pretending to be a wealthy sheikh interested in doing business with her firm. In response, she hinted that the prospective client would get greater publicity because of her royal status. The debt-ridden firm was eventually shut down. According to Kelly Goldthorpe, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer, if Harry wants to work in Canada, he would need work authorization, and may need to utilize the CETA Free Trade Agreement to get a work permit. Another option is proving that his entry in the Canadian labour market would ""have a significant cultural or economic benefit to Canada,"" Goldthorpe wrote. Assuming Harry could gain such authorization, CBC News contacted three executive recruiting firms to get their opinions on possible employment opportunities. Although Harry has limited real or Canadian business experience, Quarin said he has a number of qualities that make him an attractive candidate to employers. ""He's smart, well-educated, street-smart and he's athletically minded. He's disciplined. He's got military training.  And he also has his own definition of discipline that he's redefining for his present employer [the Crown]."" ""And ... he's compassionate. He works with numerous charities. And he really seems to like and works hard for them."" So taking all that into consideration, Quarin suggested Harry, with his military experience — he served two tours in Afghanistan — could become an ambassador for the Canadian Rangers. Harry and his brother Prince William were made honorary members of the 5,000-member unit that's part of the Canadian Armed Forces  Reserves and works in remote regions of Canada. But Harry could also become another ambassador of sorts. While Canadian pop star Drake is known as the Toronto Raptors' global ambassador, Harry could take on a similar role with Canada's national rugby teams, Quarin said.  The Duke of Sussex has been involved in the sport as a patron of the U.K.-based Rugby Football League since December 2016, when he succeeded the Queen, who had held the role for 64 years. ""He could be the brand ambassador,"" Quarin said. ""Don't forget, he used to play rugby in school. He could work on 100 per cent commission because [the rugby association] don't have a lot of money,."" Quarin's third suggestion, he said, is a ""no-brainer."" With all his charitable work, Harry could turn being a spokesman into a full-time gig. Harry is already involved in a number of charitable pursuits, including the Invictus Games Foundation,  an international sporting event for injured or wounded soliders, and  and Sentebale, an African-based foundation to help vulnerable children. ""The hard one about that is pick the one that is really near and dear to him."" Musgrove described Harry as a solid communicator, personable and likable, with good people skills that translate into a number of disciplines. She, too, said he could lead any charity in the country With his military experience, and his involvement working with injured soldiers, he could play the the same role in Canada, working with the Canadian military, helping veterans. But there are other potential ways he could leverage his military skills, she said. In 2012, Harry qualified as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, graduating as the best co-pilot gunner in his class after 18 months of training. Musgrove said she could see Harry working as an air ambulance pilot. (After his military stint, Harry's brother, William, worked as an air ambulance pilot before focusing full-time on his royal duties.) WATCH: Who will pay for Harry and Meghan's security? ""What a great story that would be.You're injured. You fall down and then you get rescued by a prince,"" Musgrove said. Or, for something a little different, why not train to fly commercial airlines? ""If John Travolta can fly for Qantas, the prince can fly me from Calgary to Toronto,"" Musgrove said. Musgrove also said Harry could get involved in Canadian rugby, leading the Canadian rugby organization to elevate the level of sport in the country. And if Harry and Meghan settle in the West, a perfect gig for him, said Musgrove, would be ski instructor or a lift operator ""if he wants to be among the people."" Harry's upbringing has groomed him for some sort of leadership role, French said. And his military experience means he comes with a lot of ""fantastic skills."" ""The ability to get things done. Tremendous perseverance. A lot of integrity,"" French said. He said he could certainly see Harry headlining a global initiative, or landing at several ""very small but very deserving organizations."" ""They may not be big companies, but they may be some not-for-profits that need an elevation. I think he's going to follow his heart,"" French said. ""I think he's going to be really focusing on organizations that are doing great work that are probably underfunded, underserviced that are making a change."" But Harry could also hit the speaking circuit, French said. ""He will be a very hot, in-demand speaker and he's an excellent speaker, he said. ""I can see him being very selective of who he speaks for. I can't see him speaking at an Apple or Microsoft event."" French said their firm always advises companies to hire ""for fit, not for skill,"" meaning they seek those who possess leadership qualities and can be trained for the missing skills. Companies are full of people who can tick all the task boxes, French said. ""What they're looking for is someone who can lead them and be the front, I think [Harry's] got a lot of that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-canada-jobs-1.5429202,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/queen-all-smiles-after-harry-meghan-announcement-1.5432694 https://www.cbc.ca/1.5432864 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988,/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933 /news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611 /news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006 /news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988
306,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-17T20:45:50.416Z,Jury selected for Harvey Weinstein rape trial,"A jury of seven men and five women was selected Friday for Harvey Weinstein's rape trial after an arduous two-week process, setting the stage for testimony to begin in the next week. The final tally mostly erased a gender imbalance that, just hours earlier, led to complaints by prosecutors that the defence was deliberately trying to keep young women off the panel. ""They are systematically eliminating a class of people from this jury,"" prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said.  The defence said it wasn't specifically targeting young women, but didn't want jurors who were too young to understand the way men and women interacted in the early 1990s. ""That was a different time in New York and on planet Earth,"" Weinstein attorney Arthur Aidala said. Weinstein, 67, ambling out of the courthouse, didn't comment when asked his thoughts on jury selection. ""Ask Donna!"" he said, referring to lawyer Donna Rotunno. Three alternate jurors — one man and two women — were also chosen. They will sit through the trial and take the place of any jurors on the main panel who can't make it through to deliberations.  Weinstein, the former studio boss behind such Oscar-winners as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006. He has pleaded not guilty and said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, he could face life in prison.  The tussle over juror gender comes amid a selection process that has been far from easy.  Weinstein's case has attracted widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement, as dozens of women have come forward over the last two years with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. That's made it tough for Weinstein's lawyers, prosecutors and Burke to find a fair and impartial jury.  Each day for nearly a week, whenever Judge James Burke introduced Weinstein to a new batch of potential jurors and asked if they couldn't be impartial, dozens of hands shot up.  Weinstein's lawyers have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to move the trial out New York City, arguing that the media hub where celebrities and ordinary people often intersect can't possibly give Weinstein a fair trial. Cognizant of the media attention and the weight some people are putting on the case, Burke has cautioned potential jurors: ""This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement."" Of more than 600 people summoned as potential jurors in Weinstein's case, some have marked themselves for disqualification by admitting they knew one of Weinstein's many accusers, had personal experience with sexual abuse or read Catch and Kill, a book by Ronan Farrow, one of the first reporters to bring the allegations against Weinstein to light.  There were others like supermodel Gigi Hadid, who reported for jury duty and wound up in the Weinstein pool, who even said they had met the defendant. One man's wife starred on a show that Weinstein's studio produced and said he couldn't be impartial. One woman said she couldn't be impartial because she has a ""close friend who had an encounter with the defendant in his hotel room.""  Another man was scratched for saying he couldn't be fair-minded because he had often spotted Weinstein in Tribeca, the lower Manhattan neighborhood that hosts an annual film festival. ""On several occasions I've seen him on the phone screaming at someone,"" he said of Weinstein. In the end, the jury includes the author of a upcoming novel that she describes as involving young women dealing with predatory older men. The defence, out of challenges, argued against including her on the jury, but Burke said she could serve. The defence then asked for a mistrial over her inclusion on the jury, but was denied. Weinstein lawyer Rotunno said the woman had lied on her jury questionnaire, but prosecutors noted she disclosed on the form that she was a novelist. That so many people in the running to be on the jury have had experiences involving Weinstein or his accusers speaks to the breadth of his alleged abuse, as well as the ubiquitous nature of celebrity in New York, where stars are frequently spotted by paparazzi and the public alike riding the subway, shopping for groceries and walking their pets. Then there have been other issues, including at least one instance of what jury consultants call ""stealth jurors"" — people eager to serve, especially on a high-profile case, because they hope to make a point or a profit.  On Thursday, Burke threatened to hold a potential juror in contempt of court for asking his followers on Twitter ""how a person might hypothetically leverage serving on the jury of a high-profile case to promote their new novel.""  Opening statements are expected next Wednesday. The trial could last about six weeks.  During the phase of jury selection called voir dire, where lawyers attempt to size up people who have assured the judge they could be fair and impartial jurors, the lawyers' concerns were in evidence. Addressing a pool of prospective jurors Thursday, prosecutor Meghan Hast signaled concerns that the sight of Weinstein, who's been using a walker since back surgery last month, could influence their attitudes about him. ""Is there anything about Harvey Weinstein, looking at him today, that makes you feel that there's no way that man's a rapist?"" she asked. No one responded. Defence lawyer Damon Cheronis told the panel that they would hear testimony from Weinstein accusers who might get emotional and cry on the witness stand. He also asked the potential jurors whether they were familiar with the concept of ""victim shaming."" Another one of his questions: ""Does anybody think an individual could have sex with someone that they may not find attractive for reasons other than love?"" No one responded. Prosecutors plan to call at least four women to the witness stand who have accused Weinstein of violating them, but whose allegations weren't the basis for the New York charges. As jury selection was getting underway last week, California prosecutors charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting two women there, one of whom who is expected to testify in the New York case.  Burke ruled Friday that if Weinstein testifies on his own behalf, prosecutors can't question him about that accuser on cross examination. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-hadid-1.5426418 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-recusal-rejected-1.5420656,/radio/day6/mourning-iran-crash-victims-former-weinstein-aide-zelda-perkins-watching-cats-while-high-design-20-more-1.5421075/former-weinstein-assistant-zelda-perkins-broke-a-nda-to-speak-out-now-she-wants-to-stop-their-misuse-1.5421083 /radio/q/monday-jan-13-2020-neil-peart-tribute-oscar-nominations-panel-and-more-1.5422602/how-will-harvey-weinstein-s-trial-impact-the-metoo-movement-1.5422635 /news/entertainment/weinstein-hadid-jurors-winnowed-1.5429125
307,Emma Davie,2020-01-18T20:00:24.209Z,'It will be a hub': New Halifax YMCA inches closer to opening,"After almost three years of construction, the new John W. Lindsay YMCA in Halifax is gearing up for opening day this spring. On Wednesday, the YMCA opened a community hub on Spring Garden Road to give people a chance to try out some of the equipment, learn more about the facility and sign up for a membership. The general manager says 300 people have already joined. ""It's really important so that people have a sense of belonging,"" Jim Pomeroy said. ""We want to make sure people are out of their houses. ""It will be a hub where people can congregate, enjoy, hang out with their family, hang out with their friends, meet new people and connect with everyone else."" Cathy Murphy stopped by on Saturday afternoon to pre-register, saying she was excited for the new YMCA to be up and running. ""It's going to be a great, well-equipped gym and, of course, we're interested in the gym part mostly, that's our biggest motivation,"" she said. ""And the fact that it's going to be so community-oriented as well."" Pomeroy said the facility on the corner of South Park and Sackville Street — which is 70,000 square feet over four floors — is ""more than just a gym and swim."" He said they will have adaptive fitness classes, like chair yoga, there's a two-lane walking track, an aquarium and a family and child community centre that can be booked for events. Until they open, Pomeroy said there will be pop-up fitness classes in the community. Membership manager Brittany Alminayan said she's heard from many people in the area who are eager to get back their swimming pool. But she says it's important for them to make sure the new space is inclusive for everyone. ""The YMCA is a charity so we make sure nobody is denied a membership due to financial circumstances, that's something we are very proud of,"" she said. ""There's going to be something for everybody."" Pomeroy said the hope is to have between 6,500 and 10,000 members once the facility is up and running.

308,Anonymous,2020-01-20T16:14:38.336Z,"2 dead in Harbour Grace following historic Newfoundland storm, mayor says","Harbour Grace, N.L., is mourning the loss of two men in the wake of Friday's historic storm. Bud Chafe, 83, died suddenly Saturday after shovelling out his home. Rupert Crocker also died over the weekend, reportedly following his own shoveling attempt. It's not clear whether their deaths are related to exertion from snow clearing. Mayor Don Coombs said he knew both of them well. It's a ""hard weekend for everybody,"" Coombs said. ""Two great men left great legacies."" Coombs said fire crews responded to Crocker on snowmobiles, but the causes of death aren't yet known and Coombs couldn't say whether the deaths were connected to shoveling out after Friday's blizzard. He described the men as fixtures of Harbour Grace, which has a population of about 3,000.  ""Bud was a legacy in the town. He was bigger than life,"" Coombs said. He added most people would be familiar with Chafe through his contributions to the Harbour Grace Regatta — and if not, they may have seen his name emblazoned on the regatta boathouse. Chafe was also a stalwart of the province's minor hockey scene, and had a major hand in cultivating a girls' hockey presence on the Avalon. Chafe also served two terms on town council. Coombs recalls his dedication to the community, like the time he saved a historic one-room schoolhouse, rolling it up on logs to another site rather than leaving it to rot where it stood. ""He was about family, he was about commitment, he was about kids in the region … and wanting things for the children,"" the mayor said. ""The things he did will go on for a long, long while."" Chafe's family asked in his obituary that donations in his memory may be made to the Harbour Grace Regatta. Rupert, also known as ""Rocket,"" was well-known as an entertainer. He gained local notoriety from his role in Terra Nova Shoes commercials. ""The town of Harbour Grace is a better place because of Bud Chafe and Rupert Crocker,"" Coombs said.  The blizzard that brought eastern Newfoundland to its knees hasn't been confirmed to have claimed any lives. A number of house fires broke out in the days following the storm, with all inhabitants accounted for. A 26-year-old from Roaches Line remains missing after he ventured out during the storm.

309,Brittany Wentzell,2020-01-20T10:00:00.873Z,What Pictou County can learn from the Bowater paper mill closure,"The former mayor of a Nova Scotia municipality that lost its major employer in 2012 has some words of wisdom for Pictou County, N.S., which is facing the closure of Northern Pulp by the end of the month. Christopher Clarke was elected mayor of the Region of Queens Municipality just months after the former Bowater paper mill in Brooklyn closed in June 2012. He said the closure was felt immediately. ""People who had mortgages, in some instances, walked away from their mortgage and left whatever equity they had, they just walked away from the community,"" Clarke said. ""Property values plummeted and have taken quite some time to recover."" Northern Pulp's effluent treatment site at Boat Harbour is legislated to close at the end of the month. Without a place for its effluent the mill can't operate. The company recently said it plans to continue with the environmental assessment process for a proposed new effluent treatment facility. Trent Hupman was at Bowater the day its closure was announced. While he previously worked at the mill, he had a large contract doing maintenance work at both Bowater and the nearby Oakhill Sawmill in Lunenburg County. ""It was very devastating for the whole community,"" Hupman said. ""I was actually working on the site that day and it was really surreal … a lot of people were unsure of their futures."" The closure threw 320 people out of work at Bowater and then the Oakhill Sawmill closed, which led to a ripple effect in Nova Scotia's forestry sector. Clarke said the Region of Queens began working closely with neighbouring municipalities in Lunenburg County, particularly the Municipality of the District of Lunenburg, to try to diversify the local economy. ""We did things like take an inventory of all our assets, worked with groups that could encourage employers to find the right workforce,"" he said. He said the provincial and federal governments also worked closely with the municipalities, which provided economic development officers, and established the Port Mersey Commercial Park at the former mill site. The park was created after the former NDP government led by Darrell Dexter purchased Bowater's assets for a dollar. The park is run by a Crown corporation and is now home to multiple businesses, including cannabis producer Aqualitas, which employs 85 people. Hupman is one of several former mill employees working at the company. The Stephen McNeil government announced a transition team to help forestry workers as Northern Pulp shuts down. Other plans include a $50-million transition fund to help those in the forestry sector affected by the shutdown. From that, $7 million will be spent on silviculture work and forest road building, a move that should keep up to 300 people working in the woods as usual for the next year. Much like the McNeil government, the NDP government set up a transition team, which included representatives from the business community, forestry sector, the provincial government and several municipalities. But unlike the Dexter government's transition team, there are no municipal representatives on Northern Pulp's transition team. Clarke said municipalities in the Pictou area are going to have to work together to tackle issues arising from Northern Pulp's closure. He expressed disappointment at the loss of Northern Pulp, but said it's important for the community to be positive moving forward. ""We started to focus on the attributes we had, the opportunities that exist here and how we could move forward,"" Clarke said. ""If there was a turning point, it was changing our attitude from 'Woe is us' to 'Hey, we're a great place.'""

310,Anonymous,2020-01-20T17:20:08.084Z,Feds give $500K to project to help promote northern mining,"The federal government is spending $500,000 to lure investors to develop untapped mineral resources in Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.  Yukon Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell announced the initiative in Vancouver on Sunday, on behalf of Mélanie Joly, federal minister of economic development and official languages.  The Yukon Mining Alliance will use the funding to showcase the opportunities in the North at the annual Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference for the next three years.  Bagnell says the conference is the largest of its kind with over 1,000 exhibitors and 25,000 attendees from around the world, and this year's event will take place in Toronto in March.   He says the alliance will establish a key presence at the conference including a media centre, an all-day forum with information on the North and a networking event.  It's part of the Invest Canada North initiative which aims to promote the territories as attractive investment destinations and create jobs for Indigenous and northern residents. ""Mining investors from New York or London may not know about the strong Indigenous corporations we have in the North and all the assets they have to bring to projects. They may not know about the strong mining organizations we have,'' Bagnell says.  ""They may not know about how open and welcoming the territorial premiers are ... and their governments are to mining. They may not know about the millions of acres of undeveloped mining potential they could invest in.'' Yukon Premier Sandy Silver says his territory is a top-tier mining destination with rich geological potential.  ""Yukon has an awful lot to offer investors,'' he says. ""We are a geopolitically safe jurisdiction and our governments take pride in our work to forge strong, mutually respective partnerships with Yukon First Nations for the benefit of all Yukoners.''",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/federal-government-money-for-northern-mining-1.5433222,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/territorial-outlook-summer-2019-1.5209133,/news/canada/north/nunavut-mine-baffinland-environment-hearings-1.5405253 /news/canada/north/yukon-mining-exploration-down-1.5364300 /news/canada/north/eagle-gold-project-yukon-gold-1.5270791
311,Gary Moore,2020-01-18T21:15:21.535Z,Fredericton boy raising money to help koalas in Australia,"Emmett Flores has had a special affection for koalas since he was born. Now the eight-year-old is raising money to help his favourite animal following the wildfires in Australia.  The Fredericton, N.B., boy was born in Australia and spent the first six weeks of his life there. It's where his love for koalas began.  His mother, Charlotte, said it all started with a stuffed toy koala that his father gave him when he was born.  ""Even when he was very young he would pull it under his cheek when he would sleep, and he would take it everywhere with him,"" Charlotte said, noting Emmett is still attached to it today. When news broke that thousands of koalas are feared dead from the wildfires in Australia, Charlotte didn't know how she was going to tell her son.  ""I knew that he would be devastated by it,"" Charlotte said.  She was right. Emmett didn't want to hear about what was happening in Australia. ""I was so sad for them. I was getting really emotional,"" Emmett said. But it didn't take long for Emmett and his family to turn the sadness into something good — and find a way for an eight-year-old to help the koalas. ""Mom thought of an idea of shovelling and doing a bake sale,"" Emmett said. Last week, during a freezing rain storm in Fredericton, Emmett spent the afternoon digging out neighbours to start his fundraising efforts.  He didn't want to stop there, despite a successful day's work.  This weekend, Emmett and his parents are baking 10 dozen chocolate chip cookies to sell. Emmett had an initial goal to raise $300 but he quickly surpassed that when word of his effort spread. The family is overwhelmed with the support Emmett has received and expects to raise about a $1,000 after this weekend. ""I'm actually blown away,"" Charlotte said. ""I was shocked that we raised $80 last weekend. I never expected any of this."" Emmett is pleased. ""There's going to be more koalas now that are going to be saved,"" he said.

Islands Trust recently issued a request for proposals to map connected forests of the 13 major islands and more than 450 smaller ones between the Lower Mainland and southern Vancouver Island.  Kathryn Martell, an ecosystem protection specialist with Islands Trust, says the federation is working to protect the sensitive Coastal Douglas-fir zone — one of the most threatened in B.C., which includes the endangered Garry Oak ecosystem — as part of its conservation plan. ""We know that one of our best ways of mitigating the effects of climate change is to protect intact forest ecosystems,"" Martell said.  ""With more accurate mapping and data, that enables the Islands Trust to better protect sensitive areas and also to better understand what areas are more suitable for development.""  The project is led in collaboration with the Islands Trust Conservancy, which purchases land for protection, and the Coastal Douglas Fir Conservation.  Sarah Otto, a zoology professor at the University of British Columbia and chair of the Nature Trust of B.C., says the mapping project will give governments and organizations a better sense of which properties should be protected.  ""British Columbia is the most biodiverse province or territory in Canada and yet we actually don't have a really great baseline data on what species are where and what needs the most protection,"" Otto said.  Mapping contiguous forests will also help prioritize which properties to buy, she says, or which homeowners to educate about the value of the forest on their land. ""Canada needs to move towards a system where people are excited if they have endangered species on their property because that means maybe they can get access to different funds or tax incentives to protect that piece of land,"" she said.  Peter Arcese, a forestry professor at UBC, says about 86 per cent of the land on the Gulf Islands is owned privately. It's also some of the most expensive land in the province.  The Gulf Islands have been repeatedly identified for their extremely valuable forests with trees hundreds of years old, Arcese says, yet the data that exists is decades out of date and was never collected well in the first place.  The risk of not properly identifying forests in the area, and thus the animals and other plants that go along with them, is that the province may not be able to reach its national and international targets on biodiversity.  ""We will continue to see the endangerment and extinction of potentially hundreds of species in the Gulf islands which have nowhere to go unless we maintain and restore these habitats for them,"" he said. Arcese says most modern mapping is done by satellite, but occasionally researchers need to put boots to the ground to confirm information like tree height and separation.  The Islands Trust says it expects the mapping to take about two months.       ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gulf-islands-mapping-project-1.5432391,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/salt-spring-island-prepares-for-future-with-less-rain-1.3583576 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-s-oldest-working-farm-is-up-for-lease-on-salt-spring-island-1.5202219 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/pender-gardom-pond-dam-demolition-1.5163882,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/summer-winter-m-s-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-tires-when-it-snows-1.5432005 /news/canada/british-columbia/kamloops-nightclub-backlash-ceos-office-hoes-theme-party-1.5426868 /news/canada/british-columbia/contentious-jumbo-valley-to-become-indigenous-protected-area-with-21m-fund-1.5431665

Monday starts in the capital with the air between -15 and -20 C and wind chill around that frostbite advisory threshold of -25. The warmest it should feel today is -10 C this afternoon under sunny skies with a wind chill of about -18; a few degrees warmer than that in Kingston, as usual. Tonight's low is -22 C with wind chill again meaning a significant risk of frostbite if you don't act accordingly by layering up and not lingering outside for a while. Tomorrow afternoon may have some flurries and a high up to -8 C, where the temperature should stabilize through the night. That's right around the sweet spot for the ice on the Rideau Canal Skateway, currently open through part of the Glebe. Kingston should get up to -3 or so tomorrow. After that the forecast calls for daytime highs around the freezing point and overnight lows warmer than the average of -16 C for late January in Ottawa. The very early outlook for the weekend suggests there could be some amount of snow that's heavier than flurries, which will of course get more specific in the days to come. 20.9 cm of snow fell at the Ottawa airport this past weekend, the most in any system since mid-February last year.

This Yukon elder has some tips ,"Yukon's been gripped by brutal cold for the last couple of weeks and it has made getting around not just a hassle — but potentially dangerous. A highway breakdown can quickly become a struggle to survive, waiting for help at –50 C. Just ask the poor folks who drove off the road last week and then set their vehicle on fire to stay warm. Mary Maje, a Kaska elder from Ross River, and her husband Ted Charlie also had vehicle trouble this week, on a remote, empty road. But Maje said they were well-prepared — so it ended up being no big deal. Here are some of Maje's tips for staying safe on a frigid road trip. Maje and Charlie were headed to Watson Lake on Monday when a belt on their truck broke. They were still about an hour's drive from Watson Lake, on the Campbell Highway — and they didn't have the spare part. It was about –46 C, Maje says. Her daughter was also on that lonely road, though, and travelling a little ways ahead. When she noticed that Maje and Charlie were no longer following, she turned back — reaching them about an hour later.  Maje and Charlie left their truck to return the next day with a new belt. ""Make sure you contact someone to your destination, and always travel in pairs,"" Maje said. ""Have all the necessities for cold weather,"" she advised. When they broke down this week, they managed to quickly get a fire going while they waited. They had everything they needed in their truck — cut wood, kindling and firestarter, and a chainsaw kept warm inside the vehicle. ""We kept putting wood on that fire,"" she said. ""We didn't even get cold."" Here's what else she carries with her: That may sound like a lot to haul around, but it's about survival, she says.  Besides, she says, ""you're not really packing it on your back!"" This wasn't the first time Maje was forced into survival mode at roadside. ""Oh no, we've broken down before at –50 — we did the same then,"" she said. ""We had our kids with us. We had them all bundled up and they were warm."" That time, they were stuck long enough to set up a wall tent with a small woodstove, and cover the ground with brush. They stayed relatively comfortable because they had everything they needed, and then some. ""When you have kids traveling with you, you have to be more prepared,"" she says. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-road-trip-cold-tips-1.5431375,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-trappers-resuce-ross-river-1.5428201 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-vehicle-set-fire-cold-1.5428598,/news/canada/north/yukon-trappers-resuce-ross-river-1.5428201 /news/canada/north/yukon-vehicle-set-fire-cold-1.5428598 /news/canada/north/arctic-cold-stalled-over-yukon-1.5421454

RCMP Cpl. Jen Clarke said it appears his death was not suspicious. She said he was reported missing in the Saint John area late last summer. His body was found on Sandy Cove Beach on Sept. 8. Police are not releasing the man's name or his cause of death. Clarke said Nova Scotia RCMP would be assisting Saint John police to determine exactly what happened.  Last week, RCMP released a reconstructed image of the man's face after working with students in a forensic reconstruction workshop at the New York Academy of Art. Clarke said the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office had already been trying to identify the man with DNA analysis, and in the end the photo didn't factor into discovering who he was. However, she said investigators were impressed with the public's response to the image of the unidentified missing man and his clothing, of which police also released photos.  ""We're very appreciative of the amount of interaction we saw online — people trying to help and lending their ideas to the post, which is great,"" she said.   ""It was really overwhelming.

316,Anonymous,2020-01-16T16:12:02.373Z,Australia firefighters save world's only rare dinosaur trees,"Specialist firefighters have saved the world's last remaining wild stand of a prehistoric tree from wildfires that razed forests west of Sydney, officials said Thursday. Firefighters winched from helicopters to reach the cluster of fewer than 200 Wollemi pines in a remote gorge in the Blue Mountains a week before a massive wildlife bore down, said David Crust, direct of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The firefighters set up an irrigation system to keep the prehistoric trees, also known as dinosaur trees, moist, and pumped water daily from the gorge as the blaze that had burned out of control for more than two months edged closer. Firefighting planes strategically bombed the fire front with fire retardant to slow its progress. ""That helped just to slow the intensity of the fire as it approached the site,"" Crust told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""The Wollemi pine is a particularly important species and the fact that this is the only place in the world where they exist and they exist in such small numbers is really significant."" New South Wales state Environment Minister Matt Kean said the operation had saved the stand, although some plants had been singed. ""These pines outlived the dinosaurs, so when we saw the fire approaching we realized we had to do everything we could to save them."" The Wollemi pine had only been seen in its fossilized form and was thought long extinct before the stand was found in 1994. The fire that threatened it was brought under control this week after razing more than 510,000 hectares. The fire also destroyed 90 per cent of the 5,000-hectare Wollemi National Park, where the rare trees grow, Crust said. The exact location of the stand remains a closely guarded secret to help authorities protect the trees. The Wollemi's survival is one of the few positive stories to emerge from the unprecedented wildlife crisis in southeast Australia. The fires have claimed at least 28 lives since September, destroyed more than 2,600 homes, may have killed more than a billion animals and razed more than 10.3 million hectares, mostly in New South Wales state. The area burned is larger than the U.S. state of Indiana. But the fire danger has been diminished by rain this week in several areas.

Wayne Carew, co-chair of the Games, recently announced the board of directors and will, within the next few weeks, announce the board of management — the nine senior leadership volunteers from across the province who will work to bring cultural events and the 24 sport competitions to life. ""It's like holding 24 national competitions under one roof,"" said Carew, who is working with co-chair Brian McFeely. Those nine leadership volunteers will recruit their own teams for a total of about 200 pre-Games volunteers. Then roughly 5,000 people will be needed for the $54-million Games slated for February and March three years from now.  That's about one volunteer for every 31 Islanders, but Carew feels it's of no concern.  ""That's the least I have to worry about,"" he said brightly. The search for those volunteers comes later. More immediate concerns include selecting all the locations for sporting and cultural events, as well as making weather-related contingency plans.  ""We'll need lots of chips, of course, but we'll need to make provisions as to how we will do those events that are getting cancelled, so that everyone will have completed the Games before they go home,"" he said. Carew said the entire Island will be involved one way or the other from tip to tip. ""Our mandate from the province … was that the Games be Island-wide and that's what we are endeavouring to do."" He said the economic impact of the Games is predicted to be about $110 million and noted that it will serve as a kickoff to celebrations for the 150th anniversary of P.E.I. joining Confederation.

318,Anonymous,2020-01-19T19:31:46.887Z,Another record year for SUV sales in Quebec as oil consumption continues to rise,"Quebec is on track to increase its petroleum consumption by more than 30 per cent over the next decade thanks in large part to continuing demand for sport utility vehicles, according to a new study.    The study, by researchers at HEC Montréal, suggests how much consumption habits have to change in Quebec if the province is to meet its goal of reducing petroleum use by 40 per cent by 2030 — a goal laid out by Premier François Legault earlier this year.  In 2018, more than 10 billion litres of gas were purchased in Quebec, a single-year record, the study says. It was also the sixth consecutive year of record sales of light trucks, a category that includes SUVs and minivans. Since 2012, light truck sales in Quebec have jumped 61 per cent. Quebecers spent $13 billion buying light trucks in 2018, more than double what they spent on cars.  Light trucks accounted for 25 per cent of vehicles registered in Quebec in 2003. They now account for 41 per cent. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, make up only 3 per cent of the vehicles on Quebec's roads. ""The big driver for oil consumption is the fleet of cars and vehicles in the streets,"" Pierre-Olivier Pineau, the study's co-author, said in an interview Saturday. Between 2013 and 2018, sales of petroleum products increased by 10 per cent. ""There are more electric cars that are sold, but that remains extremely marginal, and there's a constant increase in the sales of SUVs over the last seven years."" The study gives an overview of annual energy consumption trends in Quebec. Among its conclusions are that Quebec's existing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are falling short. Emissions, while down from 1990 levels, have stalled since 2014. The report states categorically that the province won't meet it's goal of lowering emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels. Pineau wants the provincial government to take concrete actions that would decrease the use of larger vehicles in the province. He suggested implementing higher taxes for large vehicles or levying a ""kilometre tax."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-increase-suv-gas-sales-1.5432403,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/legault-caq-environment-hydro-oil-climate-change-1.5150471,/news/canada/montreal/legault-caq-environment-hydro-oil-climate-change-1.5150471 /news/canada/montreal/electric-vehicles-commute-1.4655577 /news/technology/elecrtric-vehicle-ev-supply-demand-1.5394140

The airport decided Monday afternoon to cancel all flights scheduled for that night and Tuesday, as residents are still not allowed on city streets unless it is essential. Restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday, allowing residents to drive and get groceries for the first time in 72 hours. The City of St. John's announced that food stores within city limits would open Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Bars, restaurants, fast food chains and outlets in St. John's are not allowed to open. ""Residents please be prepared to purchase enough food for your family for 48 hours,"" said Mayor Danny Breen in a release. ""Future opportunities to open food stores during this state of emergency will be evaluated and communicated as conditions warrant."" Gas stations and 11 select pharmacies were allowed to open Monday, giving people access to essential medication and fuel for generators and snowblowers. While people can drive to pharmacies and stores, they cannot take taxis or any public transportation, prompting some complaints. ""We're in a state of emergency,"" Breen told CBC Radio. ""I don't think we can have the answer to everything. We're trying to make it possible for people to get their prescriptions and Eastern Health has a list of pharmacies they suggested we open."" Overnight blizzard conditions leading into Monday morning complicated efforts to deal with unprecedented weather. Roughly 12 centimetres of snow fell in the metro area overnight, with heavier snowfalls in other parts of the island. That brings the total accumulation at St. John's International Airport to about 90 centimetres. Mount Pearl and Paradise have about 100 centimetres. Mount Pearl Mayor Dave Aker said his city's decision to lift state of emergency bans on Sunday was to help its residents restock on essential supplies. Aker said he has been in close contact with other municipal mayors, but different stages of snow clearing and states of emergencies allowed for him to lift Mount Pearl's. ""We're all sitting around the table co-ordinating,"" Aker said. ""Our cities are in different states in terms of safety and clean up."" The mayor of St. John's spent the afternoon driving around the city with Premier Dwight Ball to survey to stark situation in which many people are stuck. Snow is typically blown up onto lawns in residential areas, but with towering snow banks and limited space, it now has to be loaded into dump trucks and taken away. Breen addressed complaints that people trying to call the St. John's city services hotline 311 to get help could not get through, saying call volume is high and recommending that people just keep trying. ""You're not being forgotten,"" Breen said. He defended the ongoing state of emergency, saying that it's ultimately short-term pain for long-term gain.  ""This is a very serious situation here … we don't want any cars on the road,"" Breen said. ""[People driving] is only delaying the process — we have to clean up the city."" WATCH: Mayor outlines plan to get city moving again after major storm The four hours of strong winds and snow set back some of this weekend's efforts to clear streets. That setback also applies to cleanup efforts on the highways on the Avalon, said Transportation Minister Steve Crocker.  While the highways are open, except Witless Bay Line, ""they are snow covered, slushy in places after last night's snow,"" Crocker said. The message is straightforward: If you don't need to be on the highways, don't try it. Crews need space to widen the roads, as parts are seeing drifts again and one lane in each direction is the norm. He said people are going to need to adjust their highway driving for months to come, noting that any new snow or high winds could fill in areas that were previously cleared. He urged people to give highway crews extra space, as workers have said people are coming dangerously close to the heavy equipment as they widen the roads. Municipal Affairs Minister Derrick Bragg said Happy Valley-Goose Bay offered to send 14 heavy equipment operators and mechanics from Labrador to the island to assist in the cleanup. Bragg said the municipalities affected by the storm appreciated the offer, but decided to handle it on their own. ""Right now, the cities feel and the towns feel they are managing. They have sufficient staff to do it,"" Bragg said. ""So we're not facing burnout yet, but if we get any more snow, we will be facing burnout, I'm sure of that."" Troops from CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick arrived in St. John's Sunday, before the latest storm set in. About 450 troops from across Canada are being mobilized in a federal response that was authorized Saturday. ""Our troops will be there as long as needed,"" said Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan at a news conference in Winnipeg. ""We'll make sure we don't leave until the job is done."" Some of the top priorities for the troops are to clear roads, attend to elderly and sick residents and ensure that people who need medical care get to hospitals and clinics.  People in need can call a hotline at 709-729-3703 to request help. The forces members are armed with shovels and snowblowers and have started digging people out, but the city says help is limited to vulnerable populations.

Ball said the military will also help dig out fire hydrants and transport essential workers. The Canadian Red Cross will also be on hand to help, he said. Troops will work out of an emergency operations centre headquartered at the MCP building on Major's Path. That hub will co-ordinate what needs to be done based on calls made to various municipalities. ""We hear lots of examples of people right now are just not able to get out of their homes, and this creates another fear and stress on individuals given the fact that if they were in an emergency, someone would have to get there,"" the premier told CBC Monday morning. ""So we need a place to co-ordinate and have this call centre set up."" For troops on the ground, they're there to follow orders as directed, and have a long list of properties to dig out ahead of them, according to Sgt. Noel Gibbons of the 37th Combat Engineers. ""That's all designated through our command centre which is obviously in liaison with the public, the town council, the city and various municipalities,"" Gibbons said. ""We're basically told where we need to go, and we go and do that tasks."" Military troops are also helping first responders, who have struggled with snow-covered streets and two different bouts of blizzard conditions since Friday.  ""We as Newfoundlanders, we come together, we help each other out,"" said Roger Hounsell, a deputy platoon chief with the St. John's Regional Fire Department.  ""Everything is starting to get a little bit normal again, if that's possible after such a large amount of snow.""  On Monday morning, Breen said police will start enforcing the rules of the state of emergency — up to a $5,000 fine for people and stores who disobey it — if needed. ""We're focused on getting the streets open and getting the residents back to their normal routines ... not in penalizing people. That said, we can't let it get out of control because we really need the streets to be open and available to the snow-clearing equipment and our operators."" After initially saying no fines had yet to be issued, James Cadigan, a spokesperson for the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary said penalties had in fact been levied. He did not know how many tickets officers wrote, but said he would look into getting more information.  Blue skies on Sunday called to St. John's residents running low on supplies and eager for exercise.

320,Chad Pawson,2020-01-20T02:00:43.897Z,"Canadian painter Gordon Smith, a beloved master, has died at 100","Gordon Smith, a Canadian painter known for his large-scale abstract work and influence on other artists, died on Saturday, Jan 18, 2020. He was 100. Smith was born in East Brighton, England in 1919 and came to Winnipeg in 1933 where he enrolled at the Winnipeg School of Art. His career as a painter and teacher spanned right up until his death. ""A key figure in Canadian art, Smith lived his life with a generosity and grace that was a gift to the world,"" said Vancouver's Equinox Gallery in a statement. Most of Smith's work reflected the landscape and natural world around him. His pieces are often a sweeping tangle of form and colour. He had his first professional exhibition in 1938.  His artistic career included two major retrospectives at the Vancouver Art Gallery, more than 25 solo exhibitions at Equinox Gallery, participation in biennial exhibitions in Canada and Brazil, as well as significant commissions including the design of the Canadian Pavilion for Expo '70 in Osaka, in collaboration with Arthur Erickson. He also produced and major works for public buildings in Washington, D.C. and London, U.K. In 1941 he married Marion Fleming and their marriage spanned 70 years. Fleming died in 2009, but together they founded the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation for Young Artists which supports art education for young students. Robert Heffel, the vice president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, began selling Smith's work in 1995. Heffel and his wife, along with his brother David and his wife,became close with the Smiths. ""Gordon Smith is probably the most loved artist, the most loved you'll ever know, everybody that met him, loved him."" said Heffel. ""He was just such a warm, genuine person."" Heffel said every day, right up until the end of his life we went to his studio. ""Everyday he painted, that was his life, that's what he lived for."" Smith taught at the Vancouver School of Art and at UBC from 1956 to 1982 when he retired from teaching to focus on painting full time. In 2017, he created an exhibition called ""Black Paintings,"" which reflected his time as an Intelligence Officer in the Canadian Infantry. In the past decade his works became more sought after as buyers around the world paid record amounts for Canadian works from artists such as Emily Carr, Jean-Paul Riopelle and The Group of Seven painters. In 2013, Smith's 1965 abstract Red Beach was featured on the cover of Heffel Fine Art Auction House's contemporary catalogue and ended up fetching $93,600, three times the high-end of its presale estimate. ""It's fair to say that when you put his great paintings beside other great paintings, he stands out as one of the greats, for sure,"" said Heffel. Smith received many accolades over the course of his career including the Order of Canada in 1996, the Order of British Columbia in 2000, the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2009 and the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts in 2007. ""Gordon Smith, an exceptional artist and uniquely generous human being, will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to know him,"" said Equinox.

324,Anonymous,2020-01-16T21:34:24.919Z,"Fear of losing access to medical assistance in dying put 'panic' in woman with terminal cancer, says son","Read Story Transcript After she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Carolyn Zicari was told that her access to medical assistance in dying could be revoked if the disease progressed to affect her mind and ability to consent. ""That kind of put a panic in us. ... You certainly don't want to end the life prematurely,"" her son Mike Cormier told The Current's Matt Galloway. ""However, the thought of her losing that eligibility and suffering for several more months possibly, and slowly deteriorating, just seemed like a tragic outcome."" Zicari was diagnosed in early December. She refused treatment — doctors agreed it wouldn't be effective — and met with a palliative care doctor within days. She was warned that as the cancer progressed, her symptoms could lead to confusion, which would make her ineligible for MAID.  To receive MAID, a patient must answer a series of questions, on the same day the procedure is administered. If the patient is deemed incompetent, assistance in dying cannot be offered. ""She was so adamant that she did not want to live a life of dependence, in a joyless body,"" said Cormier.  His mother waited to spend one final Christmas with her children and grandchildren, then called the hospital to ask for an appointment. She died on New Year's Eve, less than a month after her initial diagnosis. ""The thing that comforted me most was that realization that she isn't deciding to die — that decision was made for her,"" Cormier said. ""She just wants to go peacefully, with some dignity."" Jocelyn Downie, a professor of law and public policy at Dalhousie University, said there are no firm figures for the number of people receiving MAID earlier over eligibility concerns. ""But we certainly have a lot of reports from family members, and also MAID assessors and providers, that this is a real concern for people. It's causing a lot of anxiety,"" said Downie. The federal government is undertaking a review of MAID and whether access should be extended, allowing Canadians two weeks to submit their views online. The move comes after a Quebec court ruled in September that the 2016 law is too restrictive, overturning the clause that a person's death must be ""reasonably foreseeable."" Downie explained that ""reasonably foreseeable"" means that either the time or specific cause of a person's death can be confidently predicted. In the Quebec case, the plaintiffs were suffering from long-term disabilities, but with no immediate risk of death, she said. ""They had extreme life circumstances that caused them enduring and intolerable suffering, but they couldn't access MAID because of the 'reasonably foreseeable' criterion."" If the review of the law results in the removal of the clause, ""it means that an additional group of people will have access,"" Downie said. ""We can protect the people who need to be protected without the provision 'reasonably foreseeable,'"" she told Galloway.  ""By taking it out, what we're not doing then is protecting people from themselves."" Trudo Lemmens, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Toronto, said there are disagreements about what a widening of MAID criteria would mean, but he's worried about the message it could send. He said MAID could become a system that promotes the idea that chronic physical or mental disabilities, or just the ailments of old age, ""are in and of itself a sufficient basis to ask and to have a confirmation that your life is no longer as worth living as if you would not have these particular conditions."" He said there are also questions about safeguards, and how to implement advance requests for MAID (where, for example, Alzheimer's patients request that the procedure will be administered later, when they may no longer have full mental capacity). ""How will we decide that the person is now in a state of unbearable suffering?"" said Lemmens. Downie said that the current review should focus on people who are eligible for MAID, but feel pressure to speed up the process for fear of losing eligibility.  The larger question of advance requests — for people with chronic conditions who are not yet eligible for MAID — can be addressed in a larger consultation planned for June, she suggested. ""There are real harms associated with not having access in those kinds of circumstances, and we can fix that."" Written by Padraig Moran.

325,Anonymous,2020-01-19T16:00:00.821Z,'I was very ignorant': How being paralyzed changed one woman's view of how the world treats disabled people ,"A wheelchair user from Fort Nelson in northeastern B.C. is pushing for better accessibility for all, based on her own experiences struggling with moving around.  Two years ago, Kristi Leer severed her spinal cord in a vehicle crash. Since then, Leer has used a wheelchair to get around.  Leer says the experience has been eye opening. ""You know when I got in this chair, I'm going to be very honest, my attitude toward persons with disabilities and wheelchairs was very ignorant, and when I say ignorant, I mean not knowing,"" Leer told host Carolina de Ryk on Daybreak North.  ""The thing was I realized everybody in a wheelchair is the same as you and I ... The problem is the space we've allowed for all the humans in the world is not designated for a wheelchair."" Leer says one example is when she tries to park her car. Leer continued her work as a traffic instructor after the accident, in part by using a specialized vehicle that she can drive while sitting in her wheelchair.  However, the vehicle requires a lot of space around it so that she can get in and out of her car safely. To get in, she presses an automatic button on a remote to extend a five-foot ramp out of the drivers side. The wheelchair itself is around three-feet wide.  ""[Any parking space] needs to have an extra, I say, 12 feet beside of it for me to park in,"" she said. And those spots are hard to come by. Leer tries to park next to empty spots, but if she returns to find someone has parked in it, she has to find that person, so that they can move their car. This week, Leer met with the South Fraser Active Living group in Vancouver. The group has already petitioned local municipalities about changing their parking space bylaws.  Leer has already reached out to the provincial and federal governments.  B.C.'s Social Development and Poverty Reduction Minister Shane Simpson said Leer's experience highlights the need to make the province more inclusive and accessible.  ""We're developing the province's first accessibility legislation, which will be informed by the ideas, experiences and feedback we heard from people like Kristen,"" Simpson said. ""We know there's more to be done, but our government is making accessibility a priority."" His ministry says one aim of the legislation would be to create accessibility standards.  Leer said she'll be reaching out to her mayor and council next.  ""When you can't get around in your area, there's no point in being anywhere and people are staying home because of it,"" Leer said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessibility-fort-nelson-1.5430035,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/housebound-by-snow-disability-advocate-pleads-shovel-your-sidewalks-1.5427600 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessible-taxis-vancouver-1.5234791 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-curious-case-of-the-misplaced-curb-1.5002770,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-reaction-supreme-court-trans-mountain-ruling-1.5430426 /news/canada/british-columbia/paramedics-long-commute-metro-vancouver-1.5429708 /news/canada/british-columbia/no-phone-bill-telus-5000-1.5428591
326,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-20T11:43:26.238Z,Province cancels deer-cull program for needy families ,"A pilot project to allow hunters in Saint Andrews to harvest nuisance deer meat and feed dozens of low-income families in the area was cancelled just before it was supposed to launch.  This past fall, the Department of of Natural Resources and Energy Development announced that deer meat would be donated to the Volunteer Centre of Charlotte County Inc. But the initiative was quietly cancelled to allow the New Brunswick's Department of Health time to assess whether there are any risks to food safety. ""If you don't have something and you didn't get it, it's not as bad as having it taken away from you,"" said Donna Linton, a co-ordinator for the non-profit organization.  Linton said about 30 families in Charlotte County expressed interest in the deer meat to eat over the winter. This would've fed at least 56 children in the area.  The Town of Saint Andrews, which is trying to cope with a growing deer population, said it would pay to have the meat processed in the St. Stephen area, and it would eventually be donated through the volunteer centre to families in need.  Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health, said her office started looking into operational and food licence requirements that could support the project. But it will need more time.  ""We will be conducting a cross-jurisdictional scan to see if other provinces have food safety programs in place for similar initiatives and if there are ways to implement control measures to help reduce risks and allow this kind of donation,"" Russell said in an emailed statement to CBC News. Instead of the 40 pounds of deer meat per family, they're being offered hot dogs and hamburger meat through the local food bank. ""They have a food insecurity issue and specifically protein,"" Linton said. ""They were just hoping they could secure some food to get them through the winter."" While most of the families told Linton they had never hunted, they do have experience with deer meat. ""All of the families have had experience cooking it and were aware of the different seasoning flavours that you can do,"" she said. ""It's just kind of sad."" The poverty line in that area of Charlotte County is about $24,000 a year, but many people try to get by on half that amount. Many families who would've benefited from the pilot project either lost a job or are living on disability. ""When there's grandchildren living in the home, often they're living on the grandparents' pension.""  But Linton is hopeful the project will be able to go ahead next year. ""We're not letting it go."" Brad Henderson, deputy mayor of Saint Andrews, said the project would also decrease the town's deer population. In August, residents of the town took out a full-page newspaper ad calling on the province and the town to do something. Henderson said he was told by Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland that the project would go ahead sometime this year. ""One challenge could be another challenge's solution,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/harvest-deer-hunting-low-income-families-1.5428147,[],[]

329,Anonymous,2020-01-17T21:45:49.218Z,Firing of Vegas coach Gerard Gallant causing outrage on P.E.I.,"Summerside Mayor Basil Stewart says he is outraged over the firing of Gerard Gallant from his job as head coach of the Vegas Golden Knights. Gallant (nicknamed Turk), who is from the west end of Summerside, was abruptly fired Wednesday after general manager Kelly McCrimmon said the team ""is capable of more than we have demonstrated this season."" Peter DeBoer was then named head coach. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Stewart of hearing the news. ""I said, that can't possibly be true.""  Stewart said everyone in Summerside, P.E.I., and Canada is proud of Gallant after he led the Knights to the Stanley Cup Final in their first season and won coach of the year. The mayor said he sent Gallant a text expressing support.  Assistant coach Mike Kelly, who is also from P.E.I., was fired at the same time.  Now, Stewart is getting lots of calls from upset residents who say they're getting rid of their Vegas hats and jerseys. Stewart said he's taken off his own Golden Knights pin and will ""never wear it again."" I am disappointed and stunned to learn Vegas fired Turk and Mike Kelly. They did miraculous work with an NHL expansion team and deserved more patience and respect. Both will land on their feet in a new NHL city soon. <a href=""https://t.co/oPOSoCkfdI"">https://t.co/oPOSoCkfdI</a> ""Gerard has been a great ambassador, not only for Summerside, but for Prince Edward Island and to hockey,"" Stewart said, who reflected that Gallant had been having ""a fairly good season, too!""  He wasn't alone in his outrage either — dozens of athletes, pundits and sports enthusiasts have expressed their shock and dismay via Twitter, calling the firing ""shocking,"" ""distasteful,"" ""stupid,"" and a ""horrendous move.""  Even P.E.I. Premier Dennis King tweeted he was ""disappointed and stunned"" at the news. Stewart said he and others he's talked to are confident Gallant's career in the NHL is not over. ""He will land on his feet. With his record, he will be joining some team and bringing that team to the top,"" opined Stewart. ""Everybody will want a coach like Gerard."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-gerard-gallant-vegas-golden-knights-fired-summerside-1.5431026,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-gerard-gallant-summerside-statue-vegas-golden-knights-1.4780694 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/vegas-golden-knights-gerard-gallant-fried-peter-deboer-hired-nhl-1.5427673 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-weather-windy-cancellations-january-17-2020-1.5430515 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vacancy-rate-tough-rebound-jan-2020-1.5430815,[]
330,Joanne Chianello,2020-01-20T23:35:39.689Z,"Switch glitch, jammed doors and smoke: A weekend to forget for Ottawa's LRT","Ottawa's Confederation Line experienced several serious problems during the biggest snowfall of the season this weekend, from tripped switches to jammed doors to smoke filling the tunnel. The most significant delay for riders occurred around 6:30 p.m. Saturday — only a few hours after the snow began falling — when track switches were ""disturbed"" at the eastern end of the Confederation Line, triggering replacement bus service for two hours. OC Transpo tweeted about the delay at the time, and on Sunday morning emailed CBC News a statement explaining that ""snow interfered with the normal operation of a switch at Blair station."" The email, attributed to transit operations director Troy Charter, explained safety sensors that are supposed to detect whether people are on the tracks were being activated by snow, and could cause trains to come to a sudden halt. To get around this problem, train operators were instructed to move slowly, which would have contributed to the delays for customers. Another switch issue caused the Confederation Line to shut down on Sunday evening, again between Hurdman and Blair. This time, according to OC Transpo's Twitter feed, replacement bus service lasted 40 minutes. Switch problems are among the four main issues that have been plaguing the LRT system, along with jamming doors and two separate computer problems. City officials have known about the potential problem posed by snow on the switches for some time. Fibreglass switch covers installed by Rideau Transit Group (RTG) to prevent snow buildup have actually caused some recent delays, and have since been removed along the line. The city has urged RTG to post extra staff on the ground this winter, especially at those switches. According to Charter, the maintenance arm of RTG ""did have staff at various points,"" but that the oversight didn't appear to be enough to prevent the switch issues. There were other issues on the Confederation Line this weekend that were not made public, CBC has learned. On Sunday morning, a train was disabled at Tunney's Pasture station, shutting down service for a while. Around midday, the doors on a train at Hurdman station failed to open, and customers were unable to board or exit the train. It's unclear how long this problem lasted. Far more concerning was the presence of smoke on the line. According to social media, smoke filled part of tunnel shortly after 10 a.m. on Sunday. An internal incident report shown to CBC indicated the smoke and a burning smell were caused by a ""wheel flat"" — a wheel that has ceased turning and is grinding against the track. Charter confirmed reports of the smoke to CBC, and said the issue is being investigated. According to a CBC source, another train was removed from Blair station Monday morning after reports of a burning smell and ""train slippage."" OC Transpo said in a statement on Monday afternoon that the Confederation Line is down to 10 trains from ""the required 13"" because of a series of mechanical issues, including the problems with air compressors and wheel issues. As well, the train that pulled down 80 metres of electric cable last Thursday is being inspected to try to figure out the cause of the alarming incident.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/lrt-weekend-switches-smoke-1.5433169,[],[]
331,Sara Fraser,2020-01-18T12:00:00.708Z,8 reasons to try cross-country skiing this winter,"Now that there's plenty of snow on the ground, P.E.I. is looking like a winter wonderland — perfect for making tracks with cross-country skis.  Whether you prefer to head out on ungroomed areas, or enjoy a machine-groomed track, there are plenty of places to ski on P.E.I.  CBC asked a couple of seasoned skiers why it's their absolute favourite thing to do in winter, and how it can benefit just about anyone.  Strap on your own skis and blaze your own trail through the snow. It's best, when possible, to ask property owners if it's OK to use their property. Or, several places across P.E.I. offer groomed trails for free or for a fee.  Mark Arendz Provincial Ski Park at Brookvale has 24.5 kilometres of groomed recreational trails, 7.5 kilometres of competitive trails and a biathlon trail, plus ski rentals. The recreational trails are for all skill levels through beautiful countryside, and there is a nordic lodge to change.  The non-profit Souris Striders Ski Club on the Souris Line Road in Souris may be P.E.I.'s best-kept secret, with 21 kilometres of scenic groomed trails on 40 hectares of land — three kilometres of the trails are lit until 10 p.m. every night — and a lodge for changing and rentals. There are four trails: groomed, classic, skate, and snowshoe.  In Summerside, Heather Moyse Park and Rotary Friendship Park both have trails groomed for free cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Charlottetown maintains groomed ski trails at Victoria Park and Belvedere Golf Course for free public use. Ski trail maps are available at the parks and recreation department at city hall. And Mill River Resort at Mill River in western P.E.I. has three trails including more than eight kilometres of groomed trails and ski rentals, and one of the trails is lit until 9 p.m.  Cross-country skiing puts you on a trail through nature. You could see birds, bunnies, foxes and more as you whoosh quietly through the woods and fields.  ""It's a great way to just detach from the world and kind of recharge,"" said Sarah Flynn, the event co-ordinator for the Souris Striders. She said on an outing last week she was struck by the peaceful beauty of ""trees and beautiful white snow and birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking on trees — it was just lovely.""  ""The air is so crisp and clean,"" said Albert Flavell, 50, an avid cross-country skier and fatbiker from Summerside. He's also in charge of grooming trails in the parks in Summerside.  Even on stormy days, wooded trails can be quiet and peaceful, he said.  ""Whether it's the birds or the squirrels or just the smell of the spruce, it's a great place to be,"" Flavell said. ""Being outside definitely plays a huge role in my mental health, for sure."" ""It's an excellent workout,"" said Flynn. ""Cross-country skiers actually have some of the higher levels of physical fitness, and it's a great way to improve your cardiovascular health.""  Flavell straps on his skis three or four times a week.  ""If you want to push the pace, you can really get your heart rate up and have a great workout,"" he said. For a tougher workout, he hits the competitive trails at Brookvale (it also has easy and intermediate trails). Those looking for a flat, easy trail can try Rotary Friendship Park in Summerside, he suggests.  Skiing can be a mild or strenuous workout, depending on the pace the skier wants to set.  If you enjoy speed, skate-skiing rather than the classic old-school in-track skiing can be quite fast and exhilarating, Flavell said.   Flynn and Flavell said cross-country skiing can be a very social activity. Even if you arrive alone, you can find others on the trail to have a chat if you like.  The Souris club is starting a new night-skiing activity Tuesdays from 7 to 8, and everyone is welcome.  ""Sometimes people don't have time during the daylight hours to go but they want to go in the evenings, but it's a little bit scary to go in the dark,"" said Flynn. They'll use the club's three kilometres of lighted trails. Flavell enjoys going with a group of skiers, who often strap on headlights at night for a moonlight ski and share potluck snacks.  Because cross-country skiing is for all abilities and fitness levels, it can be great for families of all ages.  ""My mum starting taking me out when I was about five years old and we're still skiing together in the evenings, and this is 20 years later,"" said Flynn. ""It's a great way to bond with your children and teach them something new and teach them how to take care of their bodies."" A day pass for the Souris Striders trails is $5, or pay $10 for a year-round pass. Rentals are $5 per day, and there are plenty. Organizers said they only run out of skis one day a year: Islander Day, which this year falls on Feb. 17. The club keeps the fees low by fundraising. Mill River's fees start at $5 for a day pass to $35 for a family day pass with rentals, and season passes for trail use starting at $50 for students/seniors to $125 for a family.  The trails in Charlottetown and Summerside are free to the public. Tickets to use the trail at Brookvale are $10 to $12.50 for a day pass, or $98 to $126.50 for a season pass. Rentals are available from $9 to $14 per day.  ""For the enjoyment you get, it's pretty cheap,"" said Flavell. ""It definitely is a cheap sport.""  To purchase a good entry-level ski package of bindings, boots and poles should start at about $200, while a high-end carbon set can run to several thousand dollars, said Flavell — but either could last you a lifetime with only minor maintenance.  Cross-country skiing is probably one of the safer winter sports, said Flynn, compared to alpine skiing or hockey.  Flavell said he used to be a runner, but said skiing is much easier on his joints, so he is less prone to injury.  Cross-country skiing can change your mind from hating winter to looking forward to seeing the snow coming down steadily, asserts Flynn. ""I know a lot of people struggle with how long the winters can seem or how cold and frigid they are,"" Flynn said.  ""It's different when you have something you enjoy ... it makes the winters go by so much faster, it actually feels short because it's just so much fun to get out there!""  Looking for more information? There's a Facebook group called P.E.I. XC SKI where cross-country skiers on P.E.I. share information on trail conditions, plan socials, advertise skiing lessons and more. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cross-country-skiing-benefits-1.5424928,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-outdoor-rinks-1.5424651 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-7-tips-for-winter-blues-1.4973390 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/outdoor-exercise-mental-physical-benefits-1.4958302 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-winter-fun-1.5009455 https://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/how-to-build-your-own-backyard-skating-rink-1.5421107 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-canada-kensington-snowmobile-1.5422883,https://www.charlottetown.ca/leisure___recreation/programs_and_activities/winter_active https://www.facebook.com/ActiveWinterSummerside/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&eid=ARCB3Ut_sJQY8GZLLOh0QK2-c-HydPj1o0yIp5YGwvGOpU5GPP9QPuUFrncuTy3e1Xpe_t_eGfvz6op0 https://www.facebook.com/sourisskiclub/
332,Katie Toth,2020-01-20T23:00:51.099Z,Workshop to train N.W.T. health-care workers about vaccine-hesitant parents,"In the midst of a whooping cough outbreak in the Northwest Territories, the territory's chief public health officer is addressing one factor in the spread of the disease: families who hesitate to vaccinate their children.  On Wednesday, chief public health officer Kami Kandola said there were 20 lab-confirmed cases of whooping cough, also called pertussis, in Yellowknife, Behchoko and Whati. Four other people are believed to have the infection based on a mix of symptoms and epidemiological links. Eleven of the 24 people who got whooping cough were unvaccinated, according to the territorial health department. In a press conference on Thursday, Kandola said this was partially because of ""vaccine-hesitant parents, absolutely."" Canada sets targets for ideal vaccine uptake, Kandola told CBC News on Monday. For the vaccine that responds to pertussis, Canada has a target of 95 per cent uptake. But in the Northwest Territories, as of 2017, only 80 per cent of two year olds had received the vaccine. ""We are below the target, and I'm hoping that with ... spreading the word we can get more and more parents to make sure that the children are up-to-date on their vaccines,"" said Kandola. Kandola was speaking outside a workshop that was organized months before the pertussis outbreak. The Canadian Pediatric Society was training front-line health workers on how to deal with parental hesitancy to vaccines. According to the the Northwest Territories' health department, 52 people in the N.W.T. and Yukon took part in the workshop.  Dr. Sam Wong, the president-elect of the Canadian Pediatric Society, chaired the event. He has a message for front-line workers who deal with vaccine hesitancy: keep the lines of communication open and stay patient. Wong, who also works as a consulting pediatrician in the Northwest Territories, says it's important for health care providers to listen to parents' questions and concerns so they can offer evidence-based answers.  ""We always hear about the 'anti-vaccine people,'"" Wong said to CBC News, adding it's much more common for parents to be unsure about vaccines than opposed outright. ""If their concerns are addressed then they may actually be interested in actually having their child vaccinated.  ""Sometimes it takes a little bit of communication to find out what the concerns are."" Wong says there have been times where he had three or four conversations and doctor's visits before a parent became interested in immunizing their child against diseases like pertussis or measles, mumps and rubella.  The Canadian Pediatric Society suggests providers ask patients and their parents about what the fears are so they can be addressed, and focus on the issues on the parents' minds. For example, if pain is the concern, Wong would let a parent know babies under three months — who haven't yet experienced the world of solid food — can be distracted from it with a few drops of sugar water. ""Babies are not exposed to a lot of flavours ... it's kind of mind blowing for their taste buds. They're like, 'Whoa, what is this that's in my mouth?' They don't actually feel the pain."" Hesitancy to vaccines is not the only reason people fall behind on their shots. Sometimes other commitments result in families postponing immunization appointments.  Kandola also wants people to stay on top of any booster shots they may need. In the case of this pertussis outbreak, five of the people who contracted whooping cough had been vaccinated in the past, but didn't have their shots up to date. Some vaccines require multiple doses to remain robust, and no vaccine is 100 per cent effective.  She says even families who are vaccinated should call their public health office if they have pertussis-like symptoms.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-vaccine-hesitation-workshop-1.5433106,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-cheat-sheet-1.5431394 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whooping-cough-pertussis-nwt-confirmed-1.5396024,/news/canada/north/yellowknife-tlicho-region-whooping-cough-1.5428641 /news/canada/marketplace-inside-the-anti-vaccination-movement-why-more-are-falling-for-their-dangerous-message-1.5431694 /news/health/measles-undervaccinated-1.5094362

New Brunswick is experiencing some extreme winter weather. Schools in the Tantramar region and Shediac Cape are closed because of slippery roads and poor visibility. Parts of northwest New Brunswick are under an extreme cold warning for Friday into Saturday morning. Temperatures will dip to –26 C overnight with winds gusting near 20 kilometres an our in these places: The wind chill will make it feel like –35 C or –40 C. The dip in temperatures is caused by a cold air mass settling in behind a departing low pressure system.  Extreme cold warnings are issued when temperatures create a stronger risk of frostbite and hypothermia. Environment Canada says people should watch for cold=related symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes. Frostbite can develop within minutes on exposed skin.  Other areas of the province are also experiencing cold temperatures and bitter wind gusts.  In Fredericton, the temperature will reach a high of –14 C today, but the windchill will make it feel like –27 C. In Saint John, the temperature will fall to –16 C this afternoon and feel like –25 C with the windchill.  Moncton will see a low of –17 C this afternoon.

334,Tony Davis,2020-01-19T12:00:33.121Z,How 'absolute terror' led this P.E.I. man to start a podcast about mental health,"Feeling alone is a common theme on Matt Burke's podcast about mental health. The 24-year-old started Matty's Mental Health Podcast about 10 months ago and since then has recorded 21 episodes in his Charlottetown home, covering a wide range of topics including his own story. ""The purpose of the podcast is to provide a platform where people can share their stories with mental health."" He said a lot of people feel like they have to fight their mental health battles on their own, and through the podcast, he wants to show them they don't have to.  On the podcast he has spoken to people about things such as depression, anxiety and how concussions can affect a person's mental health. ""I've had counsellors on there. They talked about mental health from their side,"" he said.  ""A lot of interesting people. I've learned a lot from them."" Burke said he is not a mental health professional ""by any stretch of the imagination,"" but he has had his own struggles with mental health and revealed his story on Episode 9. When Burke was 20, his girlfriend took her own life. The couple was having a difficult time and while he was out one night his cellphone died as the two were texting back and forth. The following morning he was cleaning off his car to go check on her when her parents pulled into the driveway and told him his girlfriend had killed herself. ""It was just absolute terror,"" Burke said. He couldn't wrap his head around it. He was a mess and he got sick to his stomach. ""I completely lost it. I went into a rage. I punched the ground. I went into my house and I punched holes in the wall,"" he said. His girlfriend's family insisted he come with them for the day and he went. He said they talked him down from his emotions. ""I was lucky they took me in right away and treated me as family,"" he said. Now, with the podcast he is hoping to provide similar support by discussing mental health with others. ""I just knew right away that I was just looking to make a positive out of it somehow,"" he said.  ""Like 'How can I help? How can I move this forward? Take this experience and help somebody else that was in the same situation she was in,'"" Burke said. He said he wasn't sure what form that help would take until he found podcasting and decided to start inviting Islanders to discuss mental wellness. Mark Burke — no relation to Matt — was on the latest episode of the podcast. He played hockey on P.E.I. for about 16 years, from squirts to junior, he said. In December of 2016 he suffered a concussion and returned to the ice after two weeks. Two-and-a-half months later he suffered another concussion. That's when he realized they were taking a toll on his mental health. ""Anxious, like constantly. I'd go through bouts of depression from it. Just almost felt sort of stuck in a fight or flight state,"" Mark said.  ""Mood swings would randomly happen. I would go from somewhat happy, to mad as crazy over something silly to almost being in tears and that could all happen in a span of 15 minutes."" While he was experiencing this, he was going through changes in his life and had just moved out on his own, so he attributed the mental health issues to that. He said he didn't really think his mental health was impacted by the concussions until he heard former Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas talk about how his mental health was affected by concussions. Traumatic brain injuries left undiagnosed &amp; uncared for can rob you of your quality of life<br><br>Isolation, impulse control issues, our sense of self &amp; the way we view the world are just a few of the symptoms<br><br>Thx Tim for speaking ur truth<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bruins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Bruins</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHL</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TBI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/concussion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#concussion</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#mentalhealth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ItGsDVKE6E"">pic.twitter.com/ItGsDVKE6E</a> Mark only told his parents about a month ago and the family went to see a mental health professional together. ""He referred me to a neurologist, so we are in line for that,"" Mark said.  Mark also struggles with small talk following the concussions and appearing on the podcast was a way of addressing that issue. ""That felt real good, just to kind of air it all out,"" he said. ""I got to keep moving forward and make myself better every day to kind of set a good example — that when you do tell your story it really does help."" Mark said he was able to relate to Matt knowing he also struggled with mental health. The year after his girlfriend died Matt was in shock. He couldn't sleep or focus. ""It is kind of a tornado of emotions,"" he said. ""You know, a big thing for me, I started therapy right away and that was huge for me. That probably saved my life."" Matt said just talking about what was going through his mind helped. One thing he started to do, that he still does, is go on hikes with his dogs for hours at a time. ""I just work through everything that is going on in my mind,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a meditation time, and I always felt a little bit better."" Matt said he hopes his girlfriend would be proud of the work he is doing now. He said if what he's doing helps one person, ""it'll be worth it for me."" Ronnie McPhee, a community liaison for the city of Charlottetown, was a recent guest on the podcast. McPhee said listening to Matt and his guests open up about their mental health troubles inspired him and gave him the confidence to take his turn at the microphone. When McPhee was younger he struggled with his mental health, and at one point, he spent time in the hospital. ""It gave me the opportunity to put myself in a comparable setting to other people who had challenges like this,"" he said. ""It just showed me how I could offer up my advantages to support others."" Being able to talk and help others deal with their mental health struggles has helped him cope with his own, McPhee said. ""That was always a good feeling to me. That's kind of how I found my way of coping with the challenges I kind of grew up with,"" he said. Burke hasn't had to look for guests very often because many people have asked if they can be part of the podcast. ""I'm just like honoured to do it and I am so thankful for all the guests that reach out to me,"" he said. ""I know how hard it is to tell your story."" He said organizing a traumatic story, to ""go back to that point and really dive into it,"" can be difficult. ""The main thing I try to do is get out of the way and let them tell their story and I think by them sharing it'll just benefit anyone who listens who is going through the same thing,"" he said. ""And even people who aren't going through the same thing, just to understand what people go through."" One takeaway he hopes listeners walk away with is that mental health issues are common. Having lost someone very close to suicide, Matt does worry about some of the people he interviews. ""I never try to force anyone to come on,"" Burke said. ""I want to make sure they are in a good enough place to come on."" When referring to his girlfriend's death, Burke said ""mental illness took her life."" He said in the last few years the discussion around mental health has become more compassionate. ""Bringing these things to light and being more compassionate about it is 100 per cent the way to go in the future.""

An officer was dispatched Friday morning, said a statement from the force, after a report of what appeared to be clothing spotted in the snow in a residential driveway. ""The responding officer saw footprints and then waded through knee-high snow,"" said the police. The officer found a 16-year-old girl who was almost totally covered by snow.

336,Anonymous,2020-01-16T13:03:21.082Z,Petition calling for koalas to be introduced to New Zealand met with skepticism from ecologists,"A petition calling for koalas to be introduced to New Zealand in order to save the species from extinction following massive wildfires ravaging Australia is being met with skepticism from ecologists. ""Bringing species to other countries and introducing them into places where they haven't been previously is never a good idea,"" Dr. Andrea Byrom, an ecologist and director of New Zealand's Biological Heritage National Science Challenge, told The Current's Matt Galloway. ""It never goes well when you isolate a species away from its whole ecosystem."" The appeal, which was launched on Jan. 1 and has gained over 15,000 signatures, says the koalas could thrive in New Zealand's introduced eucalyptus plantations that are located in the central North Island and are similar to much older forests in Australia.  Eucalyptus trees, which are the main food source of the koala, have been devastated by massive wildfires burning across Australia since October. The huge and unpredictable fires have killed 27 people and more than a billion animals are feared dead as over 103,000 square kilometres of land has been scorched​​​​​, an area roughly twice the size of Nova Scotia. ""If we don't act now, the extinction of the koala will be the fault of not just Ozzies, but also all us Kiwis...,"" the petition said.  Byrom says while she appreciates the petition's sentiment, New Zealand has had a long history of struggling with invasive species. ""We've had lots of species here in New Zealand go extinct due to the introduction of mammals,"" she said. New Zealand's only native mammals are three types of bats and a number of marine species, including seals, dolphins and whales, according to New Zealand's Department of Conservation. She adds that New Zealand is one of the strictest ""biosecurity regimes in the world because we have a lot of things that we want to protect."" Some of the most destructive introduced animals include the Canadian weasel and the Australian bushtail possum, which can carry bovine tuberculosis, a disease that impacts New Zealand's primary industries, particularly the beef and dairy sectors, Byrom says. ""Invasive means that they start to cause problems for humans or for other parts of native flora and fauna in the ecosystem,"" she said. While not a good idea, Byrom says the chances of koalas surviving if introduced would be ""quite high"" because parts of New Zealand have relatively similar climates to the animals native habitat of Victoria.  But help should instead be focused on rehabilitating and regenerating Australia's own ecosystem to support koalas rather than bringing the species to New Zealand, she says. ""I think it's great that people care. And I think if the koala is a flagship for the other problems that this whole situation has highlighted, then that's a really good thing. ""We should be sitting up and paying attention to the plight of the koala and all the other animals and all the other plants and all the functional parts of the system that we don't think about — like this soil productivity and so on — that had been impacted in this terrible situation.""

337,Anonymous,2020-01-19T22:01:27.459Z,Extreme winter storm: Photos from eastern Newfoundland's monster blizzard,"An extreme blizzard left streets deserted across much of eastern Newfoundland, trapping some people in their homes and prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in St. John's. Here are some scenes, below, of conditions in the provincial capital, where Mayor Danny Breen said businesses were to remain closed on Saturday and all vehicles are prohibited from using city streets, except emergency vehicles. Snow was piled high over and around vehicles in the city's Battery neighbourhood. Even those who managed to leave their homes had no way of travelling far. At the peak of the storm on Friday, even snowplows were halted due to near-zero visibility. This dog had to navigate around growing snowdrifts. Snow surrounded the entrance to this basement apartment in the Airport Heights neighbourhood. Here's a doorway that was previously blocked due to snow and high winds that hit 157 km/h at the storm's peak. Some ventured out on Saturday to carve pathways around homes in the city.  The door of this shed blew open in the Kibride neighbourhood of St. John's.  Blizzards are common in Newfoundland, but this storm was set apart by very strong winds and for breaking a single-day snowfall record, which was set in 1999. Despite a state of emergency in St. John's that ordered business to close, people were seen lining up outside Walsh's Store on St. Clare Avenue on Saturday evening. The queues continued on Sunday. The state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's left many businesses closed — with the exception of pharmacies and service stations that provide fuel for snow removal. Snow removal efforts ramped up on Sunday. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said up to 300 Canadian Armed Forces members are on their way. But it wasn't all work in the capital. While the city pleaded for everyone to stay off the streets, some snowboarders found the fresh powder irresistible. There was also a new arrival at the height of the blizzard on Friday — an aptly named one too. Levi Jacob Snow was born at the Health Sciences Centre; his father, Kyle Snow, posted a photo on a local storm information page asking for help shovelling out their home, and people answered the call.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,[],/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-1.5432023 /news/thenational/braving-the-n-l-blizzard-1.5431985 /news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/the-n-l-storm-through-the-lens-of-cbc-journalists-1.5431936 /news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/blizzard-newfoundland-1.5430457 /news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/avalanche-battery-blizzard-evacuation-st-johns-1.5431805 /news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/storm-missing-newfoundland-1.5431916
338,Mark Gollom,2020-01-20T16:54:07.367Z,What we know about how Trump's impeachment trial will unfold,"On Dec. 18, U.S. President Donald Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He now faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. Trump is accused of abusing his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress in the ensuing probe. The president has insisted he did nothing wrong. At the end of the trial, the Republican-controlled Senate will vote on whether Trump should be removed from office. Here's what we know about procedure and potential wild cards at the trial that is set to start Tuesday afternoon. WATCH: Why is a Senate impeachment trial different? House impeachment managers Seven Democratic members of the House of Representatives, who were chosen by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will make the case against Trump, making them de facto prosecutors: Of all the managers, only Demmings is without a law degree. However, she does have law enforcement experience, as she was the former police chief of Orlando. One or more of them will give opening statements and legal arguments and closing arguments. They will also question any witness who might be called to testify. Trump's defence team Although there's nothing that precludes the president appearing at his own impeachment trial, Trump is not expected to show up during the proceedings. Instead, he will be represented by a bevy of high-profile lawyers. They will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump's private attorney Jay Sekulow. But his team also includes former independent counsel Ken Starr, who paved the way for the impeachment of Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998, and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz. His lawyers will present their case for the president, and be allowed to cross-examine the impeachment managers, along with any witnesses. Senators' role The senators are effectively the jury, who will ultimately vote 'yea' or 'nay' to remove the president from office. They have all sworn an oath to be impartial, meaning their decision, in theory anyway, is not supposed to be based on any political considerations, even though many have already indicated how they're likely to vote, based on party affiliation. The senators are not involved during the trial in making the case against Trump, or defending him, but they will rule on procedures, how to handle motions, and decide whether or not witnesses will be called. They may also be allowed to ask questions, if the trial follows similar procedures to those of the Bill Clinton impeachment trial. In that trial, questions were asked through the chief justice. Supreme Court Chief Justice The presiding officer of the trial will be Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, however, his role is limited. Unlike a trial judge, Roberts won't be ruling on objections, but he does have contempt authority, if, for example, a witness refuses to testify. He will rule on the relevance of material, but the Senate majority can overrule his rulings. Likely outcome Although the senators are supposed to be impartial and keep an open mind, all indications point to an acquittal for Trump. The Republicans have a slight majority in the Senate, but for Trump to be removed from office, two-thirds must vote against the president. Procedures Currently, the Senate has a set of bare bones, impeachment rules that need to be fleshed out, something that is expected to happen on Tuesday. For example, it needs to be determined how long the house impeachment managers and the president's defence team will have to present their respective cases. Also will questions be allowed to be asked? And then, of course, the big question – will witnesses be called? Some of the procedural details should be made clear on Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Length of trial Clinton's impeachment trial lasted five weeks. Each side had 24 hours to present its case, and there were 16 hours set aside for senators to ask questions. Those questions, though, were written, submitted to the presiding judge, former Supreme Court justice William Rehnquist, who asked the questions on behalf of the senator. University of Baltimore constitutional law professor Kimberly Wehle said it's hard to know how long the trial will last. ""It's impossible to predict because we don't know the rules of the game yet. If the rules of the game include witnesses, then it could be weeks."" New bits of information Only days before the trial, more information related to the Ukraine scandal has emerged. For example, Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, said in a recent interview that Trump was directly involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic rival Joe Biden. He told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that he, on the behest of Giuliani, delivered an ultimatum to the incoming Ukraine president that no senior U.S. officials would attend his inauguration and U.S. security aid would be withheld if an investigation into Biden wasn't announced. So it's certainly possible more relevant information could be revealed during the trial. Battle over witnesses ""That's one potential wildcard because you don't know what particular witnesses will say,"" said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. Joshua Kastenberg, law professor at the University of New Mexico, said when it comes to procedural matters, expect ""fireworks"" when Democratic and Republican senators start haggling over the issue of witnesses. While the Republicans are resistant to any witnesses being called, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated he would like to subpoena at least four: former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, Mulvaney's senior adviser, and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security at the Office of Management and Budget. Bolton, who left the White House in September, has said he would be willing to testify. Parnas, as well, has indicated he would testify at the trial. The Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, meaning the Democrats need four Republicans to vote with them to agree for witnesses to be called. ""Are there four Republicans who feel compelled that the nature of the trial demands that they hear from people with potentially informative information about the president's role?"" asked Binder. Some Republicans have been meeting privately to guarantee that witnesses be called, The Associated Press reported. (For example, Republican Senator Susan Collins has already indicated she would likely support such a motion.) The president himself has said he is open to hearing from some witnesses, but those include Schiff, Biden and his son Hunter Biden and the two whistleblowers, in connection with the Ukraine scandal. Trump and Republicans have raised questions over Hunter Biden's role on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was vice president and oversaw policy in the region. Trump is keen to see him questioned as a way of creating doubts about his opponent. Trump's defence The House impeachment hearings already laid out a preview of what to expect in terms of the case the managers will be making against the president. But it's not exactly clear how his team will defend him. 'Is it that he did nothing wrong, that these were all his powers? Or that maybe he shouldn't have done X, Y, Z, but they're not impeachable,"" said Binder. Trump's Twitter The president isn't known to hold back on his opinions, particularly on issues related to himself. He has already dismissed the entire impeachment process as a ""hoax."" ""I think the other element of uncertainty here is how the president reacts as he's presumably glued to watching the managers, who he will see as a personal attack on him by a rather diverse group of House Democrats,"" said Binder. ""And also ... will the president think the defence that has [been] mounted right for him?"" Roberts vs. Rehnquist ""It's unclear what Chief Justice Roberts will do with respect to the scope of his role,"" Wehle said. ""That's not well-defined."" During the Clinton impeachment trial, Rehnquist took a very ceremonial role, she said  ""His position was 'I'm just here, almost like a figurehead. He referred a lot of the issues to a Senate parliamentarian expert and didn't actually weigh in and make any substantive rulings."" She said Roberts, though, could take an interest in bringing decorum and fairness to the process. Kastenberg said Rehnquist, with his government experience, was considered a no-nonsense kind of a guy who could keep order during the Clinton trial. ""The Senate is different today. I'm not sure John Roberts can. It'll be interesting to see him try to keep control."" Senators flip? While Trump's acquittal is expected, it will be interesting to see if any Republican votes for the president's removal or any Democrat votes for him to remain in office. Any votes against party lines are expected in the motions, where some Republicans may go against the majority of their party and, agree, for example, that witnesses be heard. Since Trump's removal from office is unlikely, the Democrats, quite simply, want to impose as much political pain as they can on individual Republican senators and the president. With an election around the bend, it's all directed toward regaining the majority in the Senate, and dumping Trump in the next election, said William Schneider, a professor of policy, government and international affairs at George Mason University. ""It's not going to put him in jail, it's going to throw him out of office. It just provides ammunition for the Democrats. And that's valuable."" But some Democrats, like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, can't afford for the trial to drag on too long. They need to get back to campaigning for the upcoming presidential primaries. ""Republicans want to cut it, cut it as short as possible,"" said Schneider. ""They want it all over and done with and forgotten,"" he said. ""The Republicans just want to get this over as quickly as possible."" However, they do have to worry about the perception that they are not being fair and ""railroading the thing through … because you've got to understand, this is a country that gets trials."" He said they will have to allow at least a couple of witnesses who support conviction, ""otherwise, the process will easily, quickly be denounced as unfair."" Certainly he wants to remain in office. But Trump also wants total vindication, that he did nothing wrong. He also wants to inflict as much damage as he can on his Democratic rivals, particularly Biden, which is why he is hoping some of his preferred witnesses may make an appearance.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-1.5429169,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-defence-1.5432304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iowa-new-hampshire-democratic-primaries-1.5427362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/house-impeachment-managers-1.5427543 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/dc-impeachment-wrap-thursday-1.5429186,/news/world/trump-impeachment-defence-1.5432304 /news/world/iowa-new-hampshire-democratic-primaries-1.5427362 /news/world/house-impeachment-managers-1.5427543 /news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900 /news/world/dc-impeachment-wrap-thursday-1.5429186
339,Belle Puri,2020-01-17T10:00:00.301Z,This paramedic commutes 6 hours to work in Vancouver because he can't afford to live there,"At the end of his 12-hour shift as a paramedic Mark Crighton goes ""home"" to a spare bedroom at a relative's house in Richmond, B.C.  Crighton, 46, works in Vancouver, but lives in Parksville, B.C., on Vancouver Island, and can travel up to six hours each way depending on traffic and ferry conditions. He makes the journey at the start and end of his four-day rotations because, he says, it's too expensive to live in the Lower Mainland.  ""I would love to go home and to see my wife, but it's the price I pay to do the job,"" said Crighton on a snowy night outside Vancouver's Downtown Eastside ambulance station.  Crighton is one of nearly 200 B.C. paramedics who work full time in Metro Vancouver, but live as far away as Vancouver Island or the Okanagan so they can make ends meet.  The first responders and their union say Metro Vancouver's affordability crisis is forcing people to make choices they never would have made in the past.   Chandra Koonts, 40, also lives on Vancouver Island, in Courtenay, B.C. and works as a paramedic in Vancouver.  Her husband is a mechanic and the couple has 16-year-old twin daughters and a 13-year-old son.  Vancouver housing costs for a family of five, she says, are excessive. Koonts recently priced suitable Metro Vancouver rentals at $2,500 a month.    ""We wouldn't be able to get ahead. We wouldn't ever be able to save for anything,"" said Koonts whose daughters are headed to college in two years.  In Kelowna, B.C., Melanie Stephens and her husband are both paramedics and have lived in the Okanagan while working on the South Coast.  They also have three children.  ""With our salaries, we found housing options were pretty unaffordable for us,"" said Stephens, 44, who has been a paramedic for six years.  According to the paramedics' union, a full-time primary care paramedic with three years of experience earns $74,000 a year. The Ambulance Paramedics of B.C. (APBC) says after 25 years that wage increases to $77,000. Crighton, Koonts and Stephens all worked part time in their home communities before applying for coveted full-time jobs which, for the most part, are available only in Metro Vancouver because of higher call volume.  B.C. Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) hires approximately 300 paramedic recruits annually who work part time as they gain seniority and are able to compete for full-time jobs.  According to BCEHS, based on the way the seniority system works, it typically takes four to five years to gain a full-time job and well into a career before a spot opens up in a smaller city.  ""I know paramedics in the Okanagan that commuted for 10 years before they were able to get back to where they lived,"" said Stephens, who now works in Kamloops, B.C.  Her husband recently got a full-time job in Kelowna.  Crighton and Koonts expect to be waiting years for a job on Vancouver Island.  BCEHS, however, says the latest collective agreement with paramedics will create more full-time jobs and there should be shorter waits for paramedics to work close to home.   Paramedics work four days on and four days off.  Most of those who commute make the trip down the day before their rotation starts and head home as quickly as possible after it ends.  Stephens says at one point she and her husband were both commuting the often treacherous Coquihalla Highway at the same time and hired a nanny to look after their children.  ""We would drive the night before our first day shift. And, then after our last nightshift we would drive home,"" said Stephens.  It meant they were away from their children five nights out of eight.  For Koonts, going back and forth from Vancouver Island each day would incur the expense of a ferry trip and that's too much.  Koonts now travels to Vancouver for her four-day rotation, stays in town during her days off and works some overtime shifts, and then works her next four-day rotation. She doesn't see her family for 12 days at a time. ""If I could afford to live over there, I absolutely would,"" she said of Vancouver.  Instead Koonts pays $625 a month to rent a bedroom in a house in Tsawwassen, south of Vancouver, to use while she's at work. It's not uncommon for groups of commuting paramedics to rent an apartment and share it between platoons on different shifts.  They refer to the accommodations as haciendas.  ""There's always somebody in the hacienda, somebody always staying there and it cuts the cost of rent down significantly,"" said Crighton.  ""Instead of just one person renting it, there's eight people renting it.""  APBC president Troy Clifford has watched the affordability crisis evolve over his 32 years as a paramedic.  There used to be a time, he says, paramedics aspired to come to Vancouver.  Now, he says, if they're from outside the region, they're forced to come up with whatever remedies they can to make ends meet.   Crighton and the others agree the additional cost of commuting is still cheaper than moving to live in Vancouver.  ""The cost of living here versus the cost of living in Parksville, it's not even comparable,"" said Crighton.  Treading Water is a series from CBC British Columbia examining the impact of the affordability crisis on people in Metro Vancouver and across the province, including the creative solutions being used to make ends meet.

340,Erica Johnson,2019-05-13T19:21:56.898Z,RBC customer out of pocket after fraud: What you need to know if you e-transfer money,"A system to transfer money online — used over a million times a day in Canada — is not as safe as it advertises, says a Royal Bank customer who had $1,734 stolen during an e-transfer. The theft occurred after Anne Hoover of Peterborough, Ont., e-transferred money from her RBC account to her friend Fran Fearnley, only to have a fraudster intercept the transaction and divert the money to his own account at another bank. ""I always use e-transfer,"" says Hoover. ""I thought it was a safe way to send money."" An RBC manager says an internal investigation indicated that Fearnley's email account had been hacked, and when Hoover sent the e-transfer, the fraudster figured out the answer for the security question necessary to deposit the money, and then redirected it to a different bank account. An expert in online privacy protection and security says financial institutions have opted for convenience over security, which makes strong email passwords and equally strong e-transfer questions and passwords essential. ""How you manage those passwords is very important,"" says Claudiu Popa, author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook and a cybersecurity expert who advises government and companies. ""Banks and financial institutions have made it very easy to transfer money via email. Unfortunately, with convenience comes lack of security."" Hoover and Fearnley had just returned from a trip to Mexico on March 18, when Hoover went online and used her bank's Interac e-transfer system to reimburse her pal for trip expenses. But when Fearnley opened the email and tried to accept the payment, she got a message saying the e-transfer had already been deposited. The women called RBC's fraud department and a bank employee provided the name of the fraudster, his email, and said he'd transferred the money to a TD Bank account. ""This is clearly a complete stranger,"" says Fearnley. ""How could that possibly have happened?"" The two friends headed to their local RBC branch, where they are both customers — Hoover, for more than 30 years. The bank blamed the theft on Fearnley's email security. Hoover's security question to her friend was: ""Who is my favourite Beatle?"" The fraudster would have had a one in four chance of getting it right — John, Paul, George or Ringo. In a test of RBC's Interac system, Go Public was given four chances to answer the security question correctly. ""The manager continued to insist ... that it wasn't really their problem. It was now our problem,"" Hoover says. Eventually, the manager offered Hoover half the missing funds as a ""gesture of goodwill."" Hoover filed a report with Peterborough police, but an officer told her that it's difficult to clamp down on online fraud and her fight to recoup the money could take ages and would likely be fruitless. Hoover says she feels misled by the bank's website. A webpage about RBC's digital security tells customers they're ""fully protected"" and will be reimbursed ""for any unauthorized transactions."" But when Hoover pointed that out to bank officials, she was told customers aren't protected if they use weak passwords when transferring funds online. RBC declined an interview request from Go Public. In a statement, AJ Goodman, RBC's director of external communications, wrote: ""As part of our electronic access agreement, clients commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" That information is on the bank's website, but only if a customer reading RBC's ""Security Guarantee"" clicks on a few different links to get to a clause in the fine print of a section called ""Security."" Interac makes the same security promises online as RBC, telling customers in bold print that they are ""protected from fraud losses."" No one from Interac would agree to an interview with Go Public, directing questions to RBC. In a statement, the company's senior manager of external communications, Adrienne Vaughan, wrote that Canadians must ""protect their email and passwords so they do not fall victim to cybercrime and they can safely transact online."" In another, similar case, Dr. Sylvia Veith of Prince Albert, Sask., lost $7,000 when she used Interac to e-transfer money to her son's hockey league in June 2017. That money was intercepted and her bank — RBC — blamed a weak password to a security question and told the physician there was nothing that could be done. RBC would not comment on Veith's case, except to reiterate the importance of strong passwords. Police say an investigation is ongoing. ""This idea of transferring money by email is much more risky than people realize,"" says Popa. ""Companies don't report [incidents] because they don't want an investigation from the privacy commissioner, from other regulatory bodies."" Popa says people have been desensitized to the risk of email transfers ""very quickly, almost too quickly"" because they use email all the time, so they figure it's safe. What banks and other financial institutions have done, he says, is sacrifice security to get a high number of people using the system. Last year in Canada, there were more than 371 million e-transfers worth more than $132 billion, according to Interac Corp., the biggest online funds transfer service in the country. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre told Go Public that it received 163 reports in 2018 involving e-transfers that were compromised, resulting in money being transferred to fraudsters. Popa did a quick search of Fearnley's email on www.haveibeenpwned.com, a website that tracks data breaches and reports almost eight billion occasions when personal accounts have been exposed. The same email address could be acquired from several different sources. Popa found her email was compromised on two sites when hackers attacked LinkedIn and Verification.io ""That means people have found those e-mail lists. They have sold them to others,"" says Popa. ""Different people have taken what they've needed from those lists, and that's how they got compromised, very likely."" The cybersecurity expert says financial institutions and Interac need to require something called ""two-factor authentication"" to better protect people's accounts. ""Every time you log into an account you need to use a second factor,"" explains Popa. ""A code that arrives as a text message or as a separate email to a different email address that is only valid for a few seconds or a few minutes after it's received."" He says the financial industry knows more security is needed, but is more concerned about getting customers to use the e-transfer system. Some financial institutions offer two-factor authentication as an option, not a requirement. Go Public asked RBC and Interac why they don't require two-factor authentication. Both declined to address the question. Hoover says she's learned the hard way that strong security questions and passwords are crucial. She's escalating her case to the RBC Ombudsman, hoping to prompt the bank to better warn customers they could be liable for losses even if they're victims of fraud. She's also closing her business account at RBC, after decades of loyalty. ""How can I feel confident [in RBC] when, in fact, I've had money stolen from me — clearly stolen,"" says Hoover. ""This isn't secure, and people need to know."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Caribou soup: Warms the soul, perfect with bannock and tea on a winter's day. Caribou pho: Wait... what? Imagine transforming your favourite caribou soup into a lip-smacking Vietnamese dish. Or, giving your favourite pho a makeover with caribou meat instead of beef. That's what Shayna Allen did when she was craving a taste of Vietnamese food in her home community of Inuvik, N.W.T.. ""It's not a dish you can't get here, so that's why I just tried to make it in my kitchen,"" Allen said in an interview with CBC Northwind host Wanda McLeod. Allan said she didn't have a lot of the ingredients in her kitchen, so she just improvised. ""I love caribou soup, so I said why not make basically a pho broth with it, with kind of the same concept as a caribou soup broth."" The best of both worlds. ""I used a lot of spices that I've never used before, such as coriander and fennel… with fennel it's a very unique spice to use. If you use too much of it, it can overpower the dish,"" she said. ""With those kinds of spices you have to be very careful."" The result: good enough to boast about. ""I usually don't talk up my recipes or my dishes. I usually say 'I can improve this,'"" Allen said. ""But I felt like this was one of the best things I've ever made."" She even named her recipe: Nice pho what. It's a pun, and a play on the Drake song Nice for what. Allen says she was listening to it while making the dish. It tasted so good, Allan decided to share her recipe on CBC North's Facebook group. ""Love how you did it,"" said one member. ""Shaynaaa! This looks AMAZING!"" said another. Here's what makes it even more amazing; Shayna is Inuvialuit and is just starting to explore cooking with traditional foods.  ""Although I did grow up on traditional foods, I haven't used them a lot within my kitchen,"" she said ""I'm cooking more now with traditional foods because it makes me feel more connected with my culture, my family.""  A traditional caribou base, some Vietnamese spices, a dash of hip-hop and praise on our recipe group. No doubt, it's a recipe that's making connections. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-pho-arctic-kitchen-recipe-cooking-broth-1.5429817,[],/news/canada/north/moose-dry-meat-arctic-kitchen-1.5393294 /news/canada/north/garlicky-cheese-bread-arctic-kitchen-recipe-1.5402695

They were among the 176 people killed in the Jan. 8 catastrophe, when a Ukrainian Airlines plane heading to Kyiv was brought down shortly after takeoff from Tehran. Iran acknowledged three days later that the plane was mistakenly hit by an anti-aircraft missile. On Sunday, the bodies were brought to Kyiv's Boryspil Airport aboard a Ukrainian air force plane. An honour guard solemnly carried the coffins into the airport terminal, where a farewell observance is to last until the evening. The victims also included 57 Canadian citizens, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens. Most of those killed were Iranians. The five nations with citizens who were on board the plane have demanded Iran accept full responsibility and pay compensation to the victims' families. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne met with his Iranian counterpart on Friday in Oman to discuss the investigation. ""It was a necessary step, to stand up for the families, to get accountability, to make sure that we will progress our discussion with respect to identification of the remains, repatriation of bodies, making sure that we start discussions on compensation for the families and making sure that there will be a transparent and open investigation, a full investigation of what happened,"" Champagne told reporters Sunday in Winnipeg, where he is attending a cabinet retreat. Champagne said he told Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif that the International Co-ordination and Response Group for the victims of Flight PS752 wants the plane's black boxes to be ""sent quickly, either to Ukraine or to France."" Iran is trying to analyze the black boxes, the state IRNA news agency reported on Sunday, denying a report that a decision had been taken to send the recorders to Ukraine. Two investigators with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) spent six days in Tehran and left Iran early Sunday. During their time in Tehran, they visited the crash site and examined the wreckage, which is secured in a separate location. ""It is our understanding that the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder — often referred to as 'black boxes' — are still in Iran,"" the TSB said in a statement issued on Sunday. This week, the TSB investigators will travel to Ukraine to meet with the National Bureau of Air Accidents Investigation of Ukraine (NBAAI). ""There are still no firm plans as to when and where the aircraft recorders will be downloaded and analyzed,"" the TSB said. ""The TSB will deploy a second team of investigators who specialize in aircraft recorder download and analysis once it is clear when and where that work will be done,"" the TSB statement said.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-ukraine-plane-crash-black-boxes-1.5432476,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-body-recovery-funerals-1.5421321 https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/ https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847,https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/ /news/thenational/anger-in-iran-over-flight-752-1.5425866 /news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 /news/world/iran-jetliner-unintentionally-shot-down-1.5423608 /news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 /news/world/ukraine-investigators-knew-within-hours-missile-ps752-1.5423957 /news/world/iran-missile-ps752-1.5424082

This year I've decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questions about 2020 from my clients and CBC listeners. I don't think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets. They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy — conditions that are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.  Forecast: No recession in 2020. Stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains. U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.   Forecast: Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019. Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets. During a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend to be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election. However, once a winner is declared — markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong.  Forecast: Increased market volatility with several inter-year corrections, which I would treat as buying opportunities. Entering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs. Forecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring, I believe that other international factors such as U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies. Since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a good time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments that are more defensive. As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.  Consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio. Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions.

345,Shane Magee,2020-01-17T21:55:01.170Z,Education Department backs off on workers wearing 'intimidating or violent' shirts,"A union representing education support staff says it will file grievances after at least 12 members were told to remove shirts that support a provincial labour campaign because, according to the province, they could be viewed as ""intimidating or violent"" by students. Directives from the provincial government sent out through the seven school districts in recent days warn against wearing the black and yellow shirts, or principals and other managers would tell them to remove the shirts or cover them.  Dominic Cardy, the province's education minister, said in a statement to media released late Friday afternoon after stories about the issue were published that members would be allowed to wear the shirts. The shirts show an image of a yellow fist, in comic-book style, surrounded by ""bargaining forward"" in French and English with logos for the Canadian Union of Public Employees in New Brunswick. The back of the shirts say ""Proud CUPE member.""  Theresa McAllister, president of CUPE Local 2745, said the union's legal team considers the directive an infringement of members' charter rights.  ""I think it's disgraceful,"" she said in an interview Friday. ""I think it's a push from the government to quiet us down,  and we're not going to quiet down."" She said she was personally contacted by 12 members of the local, which represents school bus drivers, custodians, educational assistants and clerical staff, who told her they had been threatened with or disciplined for wearing the shirts Friday.  A union member in Fredericton was told by school officials the symbol was racist, while one in Moncton was told it was ""sexual in nature,"" according to CUPE national representative Trent Snikkers.  McAllister said two union members wearing the shirts at Northrop Frye School in Moncton were told Friday to remove them or be relocated from their usual workspace to a smaller ""isolation room."" She said they were moved to such a room.   She said some union local members had been wearing the shirts on Fridays over the last two years without issue before the directive was issued.  A spokesperson for Anglophone East School District, which operates Northrop Frye, directed questions to the provincial education department.  Cardy, the education minister, said in a statement that he had spoken to CUPE representatives about the use of the logo which ""has caused confusion and concern in the province."" ""Next week, I will have discussions with the school districts on how we can permit members of CUPE to use the logo in an educational context and a learning opportunity for students,"" Cardy said. Emails sent before Cardy's statement between the union and the province that CUPE provided to CBC News say the employer is aware of the significance of the fist logo and doesn't intend to infringe on employees rights.  Paméla E. Boulay, executive director of employee relations with the Department of Finance and Treasury Board, wrote in a Jan. 14 email that students may not understand the significance of the logo.  Boulay said the province is concerned that the fist ""may appear intimidating or violent to them."" ""We are asking the employees for their co-operation and to exercise discretion and judgment as to when and where to wear the T-shirt or other items of clothing displaying the large logo when around students,"" Boulay wrote.  On Jan. 15, Boulay told the union the directive would not be rescinded and the province expected employees to adhere to it. Boulay said the union could then file a grievance or complaint if it wanted to. McAllister said the union intends to file grievances for each employee wearing a T-shirt who was told to remove it Friday. As well, she said the union is considering filing a complaint with the province's labour and employment board.  The department directive states the right of employees to demonstrate support of their union in the workplace is not unlimited.  ""We have put considerable effort into providing a positive learning and working environment and into preventing and addressing acts of harassment, intimidation or bullying,"" the directive states. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/cupe-union-education-shirts-schools-directive-province-1.5431071,[],[]
346,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-07T18:30:27.851Z,'A slap in the face': Little-known rule says airline can keep your money without delivering what you pay for,"A Calgary-area couple is fuming after paying Air Canada hundreds of dollars for an upgraded flight package, then being told a little-known rule allows the airline to keep their money without delivering on what it advertised. Instead, the airline offered Linda and Rick Borsato 20 per cent off a flight within the next year. ""You're treated like you're an afterthought,"" said Linda. ""'We have your money and sorry you weren't happy. Maybe we'll do better next time. Here's a discount.' That's a slap in the face."" Aviation experts say airlines can upsell passengers without being obligated to deliver or to pay compensation — because the industry's regulator lets them make their own rules outlining their obligations to passengers during a flight. ""It's not really fair,"" says Prof. John Gradek, who lectures about aviation management at McGill University in Montreal.  ""Unfortunately, that's the conditions by which the Canadian Transportation Agency has allowed the airlines to promote their fares."" Go Public found WestJet, and some U.S. airlines like American Airlines and Delta have similar rules as Air Canada. Air Canada and WestJet both say they deal with such situations on a case-by-case basis.  On a trip to Hawaii in April, the Borsatos paid $519 extra to upgrade from the airline's ""basic"" economy fare to ""comfort"" economy, which includes advance seat selection. That was the selling point for Rick, who is six feet, four inches tall and wanted more legroom. Air Canada changed their itinerary three times after the Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March.  But it wasn't until the Borsatos arrived at the airport on April 13, that they discovered they'd be getting fewer than half of the extras they bought. The airline didn't deliver on the advance seating, the early boarding or the complimentary alcoholic beverage — though the couple was able to check their first bag for free and got extra travel points. The Borsatos say an Air Canada agent told them they could get a refund when they returned home. But their refund claim was rejected based on a set of rules that Air Canada wrote itself, and which passengers automatically agree to when they book. The airline's Rule 30 says services that are part of a fare package, like the one the Borsatos purchased, are ""not guaranteed,"" and ""no compensation will be offered for their unavailability."" ""I just can't wrap my head around how that happens,"" Rick said. ""We've paid them for a service and didn't get it, but they've written [this rule] in such a way that they don't owe us anything. What other industry can do that?"" The airline won't disclose how often passengers don't get the services they pay for under the various fare packages. In an email to Go Public, spokesperson Angela Mah says Air Canada ""always makes every effort to ensure that services are provided to the best of its abilities."" She added that the ""no compensation"" clause was included in the rules ""for additional clarity."" Compensation is handled on a ""case-by-case basis,"" she said.  After the couple escalated their complaint to Air Canada management, the airline upped its offer by adding a $200 coupon to the 20 per cent discount. They declined that offer. ""We don't want to travel with Air Canada knowing that we can pay for a service that they don't have to provide us and that they don't have to refund our money,"" Linda said. The Borsatos complained on May 27 to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), the industry regulator which decides whether an airline's rules are reasonable, and has the authority to force airlines to drop or amend rules. The Borsatos' complaint is among 33 filed over Air Canada's Rule 30 since the CTA began tracking disputes related to the rule two years ago. In its nine-page response to the Borsatos' complaint, Air Canada says Rule 30 is ""reasonable,"" and that the complaint should be dismissed because the grounding of the 737 Max planes was out of Air Canada's control. The Borsatos say they understand operational issues come up, but say Air Canada shouldn't be able to keep the money if the purchased services can't be provided. After Go Public contacted the airline, it agreed to issue a full refund, but only if the Borsatos signed a confidentiality agreement and drop their complaint with the CTA. The couple refused. Mah, the spokesperson, said ""such agreements are common in business during dispute resolutions.""  It's common for airlines to advertise certain perks but not deliver on some or any of them without compensating passengers, according to Prof. Brent Bowen from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.  ""Most of the travelling public is not aware of it,"" said Bowden, who has been running an online study on airline quality for years.  ""This is how the airlines have gone from rags to riches in the past decade … they unbundle everything and don't really reduce the ticket cost to you."" He says occasional travellers should be wary of booking bundled fares that promise — but don't guarantee — extras, because they'll rarely get their money's worth. Air Canada started offering bundled fare packages in 2003 and it expanded and renamed the packages last year.  Fare packages aren't addressed under Canada's new Air Passenger Protection Regulations, which kicked in July 15. But they should be, according to Ian Jack of the Canadian Automobile Association, who had input into the new regulations through the government's various consultations with stakeholders.  The new regulations are ""not perfect"" and fare packages are ""one area for future improvement"" Jack said.  Officials should improve ""the way that various fare classes are advertised and… [how] carriers to make clear what you're getting."" In the meantime, the Borsatos hope the CTA will force Air Canada to drop or modify Rule 30, and want their refund with no strings attached. Their case is still under review.  ""How many people aren't getting what they're paying for?"" Linda Borsato asks. ""That's why we pursued this and are following through on it… either way we have nothing to lose now."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-rule-30-fare-classes-1.5304450,[],https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/passenger-bill-of-rights-details-1.5147589 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/westjet-air-canada-air-transat-porter-air-passenger-regulations-fines-cta-1.5270705 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-max-8-congress-hearing-1.5214337 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737ng-cracks-1.5301397

348,Isaac Olson,2020-01-20T09:00:00.785Z,'Our commercial streets are bleeding': City hears it's just too expensive to set up shop in Montreal,"When Susan Usher first set down roots in Montreal's Mile End some three decades ago, the streets were calm, rental housing was abundant, and buildings, many fallen into disrepair, were cheap. But she fell in love with the neighbourhood's charm, and to this day, she can't imagine living anywhere else.  In 2002, Usher invested in a three-storey, brick-faced building on St-Laurent Boulevard, with a small retail space on the ground floor, two apartments above, and balconies wrapped in iron railings overlooking The Main. Usher has watched the neighbourhood evolve into an eclectic mix of chic eateries and boutiques that are slowly pushing out the mom-and-pops — the small grocers and shoe repair shops who can't afford the exorbitant rents that corporate landlords are charging. ""We've lost some of the businesses that we were all really fond of,"" said Usher. Two years ago, she decided to do something about it.  She joined a neighbourhood committee that wants a thriving commercial scene in an affordable neighbourhood rich with urban essentials like bakeries, delis and dépanneurs rather than wall-to-wall businesses, like fancy restaurants and exclusive spas, that families in the area don't need. Her committee fears Mile End will become just as pockmarked with empty storefronts as some of the city's hardest-hit commercial strips — a fear that's shared by communities across Montreal. Usher was one of the first to speak last Tuesday, when Montreal opened public consultations on the empty storefront problem.  With the average retail vacancy rate hitting 15 per cent, and with some commercial streets at nearly double that, the city is eager to hear the public's ideas. So far, two issues have come up time and again: Montreal's steep commercial tax rate and the excessive rents property management firms are demanding. Suggestions include simplifying the way buildings are evaluated or offering educational classes to help business owners navigate taxes that feel especially unfair to landlords like Usher, with her single storefront space. The way the system works, she is in the same high tax bracket as corporate landlords. ""Our taxes have gone up from about $2,500 a year to more than $10,000 a year,"" she said.  ""The evaluation of our building has gone up 175 per cent between 2005 and today, whereas the amount of rent we charge in the commercial space has only gone up 35 per cent."" The Mile End committee's brief to the city last week suggested the city redefine those tax brackets. Usher suggested factoring in elements such as how long somebody has owned a building, or the original purchase price, to avoid placing individual owners like her in the same bracket as firms that are charging commercial tenants five times the rent that she charges. Either way, commercial taxes are out of control, according to Gopinath Jeyabalaratnam. Jeyabalaratnam, an economic affairs adviser at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), told CBC's Let's Go that commercial taxes are four times higher than residential taxes. As well, under the current model, those in high-value areas like downtown pay much more than those on the outskirts of the city. ""Our commercial streets are bleeding, and we have to stop the hemorrhaging because otherwise, we might be putting a lot more effort and a lot more money to get back to a normal situation,"" he said. But taxes aren't the only problem. Corporate landlords can afford to buy up bushels of buildings in an area, raise the rent and then wait for the next big franchise to move in. People like Usher can't afford to leave her commercial space empty for months, so she charges less rent to keep her storefront occupied. Her tenant, Robert Sutcliffe, said he searched the neighbourhood for four months for an affordable place to open Art et Son, a shop specializing in retro home stereo systems. The vacant commercial spaces owned by corporate landlords would have cost him thousands more, so he felt lucky to discover Usher's storefront. ""This one fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for,"" he said. Still, he'd like to see fewer vacancies on the street to attract more shoppers to the area. Usher is among those calling on the city to levy fines against landlords who leave commercial space empty. She said those fines should be aimed at landlords who have raised the rent more than 50 per cent and have left a space vacant for more than six months. Montreal architect Ron Rayside would also like to see landlords penalized for failing to fill vacancies because, he told the city commission, lowering rents is a sure way to attract a tenant.  Rayside, who owns a couple of retail spaces himself, is a partner in a firm located on a commercial strip on Ontario Street East.  He's always managed to keep his commercial space filled by keeping rents low, he said. Once he even dropped the rent down to a mere $100 per month, offering a local artist a short-term lease to help him get his business off the ground. The deal ensured the unit was maintained, secure and not just another vacancy in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, he said. There are creative ways like that to keep retail space occupied if landlords are motivated to do so, Rayside said. And it might take penalties to create that motivation.  But the city needs to do its part, as well, he said. He suggested more flexible zoning regulations that would allow property owners to be more creative with their properties. The Montreal youth council made a similar suggestion, saying it would like to see empty storefronts put to use with temporary occupation permits. ""You could even have other, non-residential uses that are not commercial, per se, even temporary spaces — whether it be for artists or other uses,"" Rayside said. ""Once we decide from a social point of view and a commercial and city point of view that vacant commercial spaces are really bad for the commercial artery or bad for the dynamic of a neighbourhood, then there are all kinds of different ways to solve it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-vacant-storefronts-1.5431717,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-commercial-district-solutions-1.5425673 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-vacant-businesses-1.5252028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mile-end-record-stores-sonorama-phonopolis-fines-opening-hours-tourism-1.5393131,/news/canada/montreal/montreal-vacant-businesses-1.5252028 /news/canada/montreal/montreal-urban-sprawl-1.5412255 /news/canada/montreal/hotel-motel-moratorium-st-jacques-street-1.5328622 /news/canada/montreal/food-waste-montreal-donation-grocery-zero-waste-ban-1.5323700

Spokesperson Kim Griffin said on Friday there are around 670 requests in the maintenance system to have trees — or parts of trees — near power lines assessed or removed. But all that work gets triaged during weather events or emergencies to focus on main transmission lines and areas that have greater impact on the most customers. ""That's something that goes into the system and then each district looks at it in terms of part of the maintenance that they do on a day-to-day basis,"" said Griffin. If the work is classified as an emergency — like something is on fire or a power line is completely down — Griffin said they will likely get to it that day. Griffin said the utility has more than 80,000 customers on Prince Edward Island and more than 100,000 power poles to maintain. If customers have a concern about a tree too close to a line, they should contact the company. A representative would be sent out to assess the area and include it in a district's preventative maintenance, if it was warranted. Maritime Electric spends around $1.5 million a year on tree trimming, Griffin said, with eight to 10 people working Island-wide on any given day. Dorian damage caused trees to fall or shift closer to lines all over the province. That changed Maritime Electric's priorities as they shifted to fix the most concerning areas first. ""Dorian did put us behind by a couple of months and in some areas, we're still doing some clean up just from Dorian around our system,"" Griffin said. ""There are some that could be done in a month or two months. There could be some, we are looking to get them in 2020, but there still could be some in 2021."" Griffin said they will continue assessing trees to work their way through the list. Sometimes, instead of trimming, if there is a tree that could cause a problem, the offer from Maritime Electric is to remove it completely. Critical issues take priority over routine tree trimming, Griffin said. ""So right now, as part of the job assignment, it may not be as fast as everyone would like and we certainly apologize for that,"" Griffin said. ""But we really have to focus on some of the areas that are having the biggest impact on keeping the power on.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-maritime-electric-tree-trimming-delays-1.5431498,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-maritime-electric-dorian-cost-nov-2019-1.5377438 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-maritime-electric-private-trees-1.5296345 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vacancy-rate-tough-rebound-jan-2020-1.5430815 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-westjet-charlottetown-calgary-jan-2020-1.5430670,/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-maritime-electric-dorian-cost-nov-2019-1.5377438 /news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-maritime-electric-private-trees-1.5296345 https://www.maritimeelectric.com/services/articles/tree-trimming/

Burger noticed a chunk of ice about 30 centimetres square and eight centimetres thick spinning through the air toward his Hondo Pilot. ""As I watched the ice come, heard it hit, saw the windshield shatter, I did not anticipate it coming through the windshield at all,"" he told CBC. But the ice did smash through the glass, striking Burger square in the face. Burger somehow managed to maintain control of his SUV and steered it safely off the road. Paramedics arrived and transported him to Renfrew, Ont., for medical care.  A large gash on the Burger's forehead required eight stitches, and he needed additional stitches on his right eyelid. His right pupil is dilated to twice the size of his left one, but it's believed he'll make a full recovery, Burger said.  Burger is thankful he was the one driving and not Clark, who recently received his beginner's licence. He said he had considered giving his son some practice time behind the wheel as they passed Renfrew, but decided against it. Photos taken soon after the incident show a triangular hole in his windshield. Burger has since found shards of glass all the way at the back of his SUV. Clark was unscathed.  ""He does mention once in a while that when he closes his eyes he replays the situation,"" Burger said. ""But he is doing well. He'll be fine.""  Burger is hoping the incident will serve as a reminder to motorists to take a moment to clear ice and snow from their vehicles before hitting the road. ""I want to help prevent someone else from going through the same thing that I did,"" he said. ""I am very fortunate that I am actually here able to speak to you. It could have been a lot worse.

Sunday's confrontation broke out near parliament a day after more than 370 people were wounded, the biggest casualty toll since the protests against the ruling elite began. Unrest in the capital this week has deepened the multi-faceted crisis sweeping Lebanon as it grapples with financial strains that have sunk the currency, pushed up prices and driven banks to impose capital controls. Politicians have failed to agree on a government or an economic rescue plan since the protests pushed Saad al-Hariri to quit as prime minister in October. ""We have gone from being a country we used to call the 'Switzerland of the East' to a country ranked at the bottom in everything,"" said housewife Rezzan Barraj, 47, at Sunday night's protest. ""It's clear that the more they [security forces] step up their violence, the more people's strength and determination grow."" A Reuters witness saw police fire rubber bullets. The Lebanese Red Cross said it treated 52 people and took 38 to hospital. Hundreds of people yelled ""revolution"" in the commercial district of the capital. Protesters pelted riot police with stones and fireworks. Some tried to climb over barbed wire and fencing to storm a heavily barricaded part of central Beirut that includes parliament. One man jabbed police with a pole across the barriers as the violence escalated. Zeina Ibrahim, 37, an office manager, said protesters had faced violence from police and attacks from supporters of the sectarian, dominant parties. ""Violence only breeds violence,"" she said. ""After all this time, all these months ... I don't blame protesters at all if they move bit by bit towards violence."" The Internal Security Forces (ISF) urged people to remain calm and said otherwise it would be forced to repel them. The interior and defence ministers, as well as army and other security chiefs, were set to meet at the presidential palace on Monday. Human Rights Watch on Saturday called for an end to a ""culture of impunity for abuse"" by police, which it said fired tear gas canisters at some people's heads. Interior Minister Raya al-Hassan said people had the right to protest but it was unacceptable to ""blatantly assault"" security forces. Protesters have also turned their anger on the banks — which have curbed access to savings — with some smashing the facade of the banking association on Saturday night.

359,Jonathon Gatehouse,2019-12-05T09:00:15.727Z,"Canadian stats on impaired driving deaths incomplete, years out of date","Canada's statistics on impaired and distracted driving fatalities, as well as drowning deaths, are incomplete and years out of date because the BC Coroners Service has repeatedly failed to share its data with the agencies that compile the national numbers. A CBC News investigation has determined that the information gap, which in some cases stretches back almost a decade, has held up the publication of annual reports and caused safety organizations to guess at countrywide trends and put asterisks next to their findings. And it's creating headaches for advocates and policy-makers who want to know if laws and enforcement measures are working as they should. ""It's appalling,"" said Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada. ""We're almost [in] 2020 and we're still working off 2014 [numbers]. We've had historical events in this country, like the legalization of recreational cannabis, with the big issue and debate around driving and what effect it's going to have, and we've got nothing. Nothing."" The Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA), an interprovincial body that deals with highway safety, traditionally releases its annual Alcohol and Drug Crash Problem report each January. Drawing on police, insurance, coroner and medical examiner data from across the country, it's the definitive source on what has gone wrong on the country's roads. But the last CCMTA report came out almost three years ago in January 2017. And it was based on 2014 data — or in the case of British Columbia, extrapolated 2010 numbers.  The Ottawa-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF), an independent non-profit that gathers and analyzes the data for the CCMTA report, says it has been having difficulty prying numbers out of the BC Coroners Service for years. ""We've been trying to get that data because it represents anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of the population,"" said Steve Brown, who oversees TIRF's national fatality database and co-authors the Alcohol and Drug Crash report. ""We're doing everything at our end. We've filled out all the research agreements and that type of thing."" Earlier this year, the BC Coroners Service finally provided its 2011 and 2012 figures. But the holdup continues for the province's more recent years; that's in contrast to other Canadian jurisdictions, which have all provided their road death numbers through at least 2016. ""You think, in the information age, that it would be easier to get data, but that's not always the case,"" said Brown. ""We're … just trying to be as patient as we can with this."" B.C.'s death disclosure problems have also affected an annual report on water fatalities across the country. This past summer, the Drowning Prevention Research Centre released its 2019 findings — based on 2016 data — noting that absence of definitive numbers from Canada's third most populous province. ""They weren't ready and we just made the call that says, better to have three territories and nine provinces with their data, and let B.C. catch up by next year,"" said Doug Ferguson, CEO of Drowning Prevention Research Centre. Ferguson said his centre was still able to glean partial B.C. drowning death information from police and media reports, but it's likely that they missed some cases. He worries that the incomplete report might hamper municipalities or other water safety agencies as they try to fine-tune and target their public awareness campaigns.  ""You're not flying blind, but you're using old data,"" said Ferguson. ""There is no other source as valid as a coroner's office."" Andy Watson, a spokesperson for the BC Coroners Service, attributes the delays to the surge in deaths caused by the opioid crisis and the declaration of a provincial public health emergency in April 2016. ""One of the challenges that we were faced with a couple of years ago, really, it was the illicit drug crisis was expanding, and hitting British Columbia, I think, disproportionately harder than other provinces,"" said Watson. ""It was a reprioritization of resources at the time."" But given that the timely sharing of B.C. data was a problem well before the spike in fentanyl and carfentanil overdose deaths, other issues appear to be at play. In a followup response, Watson allowed that the BC Coroners Service has been slowed by ""a myriad of factors,"" including privacy concerns, revamped research agreements, the creation of a new electronic data management system and turnover in staff. Regardless, the agency is promising to do better and says it will hand over its 2013 through 2017 road death information to the Traffic Injury Research Foundation at some point next year. ""The best I can tell you at this stage is that we are working on that and catching up on that now,"" said Watson. ""We recognize the importance of that data and that's why we're making it a priority at this stage."" For safety groups like MADD Canada, however, the promise rings hollow. Murie says his organization has been looking for alternative data sources so it can analyze trends and critique government policy without having to wait for the various federal and provincial agencies to get their act together. ""To be honest with you, in the last year or so, I have just kind of given up,"" he said. ""Because even if they were to put out data for tomorrow and it's [for] 2015, what does it tell us?"" It's all in sharp contrast to the coroner-based process in the United States, which produces updated national numbers each spring via the federally funded Fatality Analysis Reporting System.

The Second World War veteran lives by himself in Eastport, N.L., does his own cleaning and cooking, and loves a good game on the VLTs at his local legion, a building he was instrumental in establishing decades ago — just one of his many achievements during a century of life. Today, Jan. 20, he turns 100. Good genes, he says. ""My father was 92. And my grandfather was 98. And my brother died [when] he was 99 and three months. And I've outdone the whole works,"" said Bull. Born to George Henry and Suzanna Bull, Chesley Bull says he started working on his father's vessel, the Magic, as a boy. ""I was in Grade 8 then. I went on to Labrador when I was 13 years old. And I spent seven summers out there. And I had a man's pay when I was 15,"" he said. ""When the war broke I tried to join up in St. John's and I had to come back in my own district to join."" He signed up for the navy in Glovertown on March 18, 1941, and was called for duty July 1 of that same year. ""We joined the ship and went across the Atlantic. Pretty near 200 ships in the convoy with 46 days going across the Atlantic. Landed in Liverpool. Then we joined the train and went down to the Ganges. We did our training there."" Bull says the memories of his war days are vivid in his mind — like the time he was bitten by a barracuda, or when there was an bomb attack outside his boarding house. ""They dropped a bomb and glass went all over me."" After 5½ years overseas, he returned to Eastport on Christmas Eve 1946. He began working at Terra Nova National Park, then moved on to become postmaster of Eastport, and also served as the first mayor of the town. After retiring from the post office, he went back to the water at age 60. He bought a boat engine and five gill nets and went fishing for the next seven or eight years, he said.  ""Made more money in one day than a month [as postmaster],"" said Bull. Bull was married for 67 years to wife Viola, who died in 2017. The couple had one daughter, Marion. These days, the centenarian brags about his 20/20 vision and loves to crack off-colour jokes every now and then. He still drives in the daytime, and most recently made the near 300-kilometre trek to St. John's last fall. And he loves to fish and hunt when he can, with hopes to get a moose licence next season. He makes his own wine, beer, and coffee liqueur, giving more of it away than he consumes. He says he'd rather have his nightly drink of scotch whisky instead. Besides his good genes, he credits one thing for his lengthy life.  ""Work. I never stop.""

""I saw, especially during our last convention, the desire and the will for change expressed by our activists."" Plamondon, a Montreal lawyer and McGill and Oxford universities alumnus, is best known for his 2014 book Les orphelins politiques, in which he made the case that young Quebecers don't see their values reflected in the current political landscape. In the Facebook post, Plamondon said he'd like to rally together all members of the PQ ""with the objective of making Quebec an independent state."" He said the party will reach its goals by joining the forces of nationalism and social democracy.  ""There is space for everyone in the Parti Québécois, whether a social democrat or nationalist,"" the post continued.   Plamondon is the second to join the leadership race, following PQ MP Sylvain Gaudreault, who announced his candidacy in November. The two could be joined by comedian Guy Nantel, historian Frédéric Bastien and immigration lawyer Stéphane Handfield, who are still considering entering the race. The new leader will be appointed June 19. This is the second time Plamondon has vied for PQ leadership, having run against former PQ leader Jean-François Lisée in 2016.  Lisée stepped down after the 2018 provincial elections, when the PQ lost official party status.  At the time, Plamondon proposed holding a referendum on Quebec sovereignty if the PQ won a second term.  Plamondon lost the 2018 election to CAQ minister Marguerite Blais in the riding of Prévost.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/paul-st-pierre-plamondon-joins-pq-leadership-race-1.5432268,[],/news/canada/montreal/paul-st-pierre-plamondon-parti-quebecois-leadership-1.3792147 /news/canada/montreal/pq-election-results-1.4846573 /news/canada/montreal/jean-charest-upac-michel-massicotte-1.5431436

""The complication is that it's necessary within Canadian law to go to Canadian court and get them to ... stamp their approval on the claim that you're making,"" Gordon Christie, director of the Indigenous Legal Studies Program at the University of British Columbia, told CBC Radio's The House. ""But Wet'suwet'en have Indigenous title. They've been owners of their land since time immemorial. We still have to settle the matter as to how Canadian law and Indigenous law is supposed to co-exist."" Conflict between Coastal GasLink and the Wet'suwet'en people first came to a head in northern B.C. one year ago, when protesters began setting up checkpoints to prevent the company from working on a pipeline project on their traditional territory. The natural gas pipeline — which has approval from the province and the nation's elected band council — is to run from B.C.'s Dawson Creek area to a facility near Kitimat. The Supreme Court of Canada issued a ruling in 1997 confirming that the Wet'suwet'en had never given up title to their lands. The top court's recommendation to send the case back to trial was never followed. ""The nature of the title that they hold within Canadian law would have been settled through trial,"" Christie said. Tensions were stoked earlier this week when the RCMP set up a new checkpoint blocking access to Wet'suwet'en territory on a service road leading to the company's work site and three camps occupied by protesters. B.C. Premier John Horgan also came in for criticism over comments he made Monday backing an injunction Coastal GasLink obtained in December, which declared protests near the construction site must end. But critics say both Ottawa and the B.C. government's commitment to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) goes against the pipeline's approval because hereditary chiefs did not consent — and seeing UNDRIP become a meaningful reality could be a long way off. ""Nothing has happened immediately in B.C. with the legislation becoming ratified recently,"" Christie said. ""I think what we're looking at is just a very long process [with] the province and the federal government.""",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/legal-divide-lies-behind-wet-suwet-en-pipeline-protest-expert-says-1.5431526,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/miscommunication-three-people-turned-away-1.5428447 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-checkpoint-coastalgaslink-wetsuweten-1.5427015,/radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624/the-world-wanted-maduro-gone-so-why-is-he-still-calling-the-shots-in-venezuela-1.5431531 /radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624/legal-divide-lies-behind-wet-suwet-en-pipeline-protest-expert-says-1.5431526 /radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624
365,Laura Osman ,2020-01-20T09:00:00.549Z,"For car buyers caught in a bad deal, the road to restitution's a long one","A dissatisfied Ottawa car buyer is warning about a lack of protection for people who purchase vehicles in Ontario, after losing thousands of dollars and receiving little help from the provincial regulator. Henry Patterson has learned firsthand how difficult it is for car buyers to recoup their losses if a dealer isn't willing. In November, Patterson bought a used 2001 Toyota 4 Runner from Metro Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram for $3,704.05, as a final sale. He got his mechanic to look the SUV over before he bought it, and while he knew it needed some work, the paperwork provided by the dealer showed no issues with the subframe or suspension.  But when his mechanic hoisted up the SUV after the purchase, they discovered it wasn't salvageable. ""[The] underneath is completely rotted and rusted,"" he said. ""A polished turd."" Two mechanics who spoke to CBC News said there was no way the vehicle could be certified for safety, as the frame was too far gone.  In response to CBC's questions, Metro Chrysler wrote that Patterson had the opportunity to inspect the car before he bought it. He also signed an ""as-is"" agreement, which clarified the vehicle may not be fit for the roads and may require substantial repairs at the buyer's expense. The dealer refused to take the car back and refund his money, so Patterson turned to the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council (OMVIC), the province's regulator for vehicle sales. Failure to disclose certain issues — for instance, if the car was in a wreck — can trigger a cancellation of the sale.  Patterson said he expected OMVIC could order the dealership to reimburse him, since they didn't disclose a major problem with his SUV. But the organization was only able to issue a letter he could take to small claims court, informing the judge that Patterson had already tried to resolve the issue through OMVIC. Unfortunately, the cost of going to court, Patterson said, is about the same as what he paid for the car.  ""They can't do anything for people,"" Patterson said. ""They can hold your hand and tell you that the ouchie is going to go away, but it doesn't."" While OMVIC does try to mediate between sellers and buyers when there's a complaint, the council lacks the power to ""compel restitution,"" said communications director Terry O'Keefe. ""We don't have the authority to order the dealer to pay it,"" O'Keefe said. ""We can't order the dealer to conduct repairs, and we can't order a dealer to take a vehicle back.""  Last year OMVIC mediated 1,149 complaints and had success in about 50 per cent of cases, O'Keefe said. Those negotiations resulted in about $1.7 million in restitutions, not including repairs dealers agreed to make.  In cases where the customer doesn't get satisfaction, OMVIC still investigates poor behaviour and illegal activity and can impose penalties for breaking the rules — by issuing fines, revoking licences and even ordering jail time.  But that doesn't help customers who lost money. ""We can't go into a dealer's bank account and take money out, even if we think the consumer is entitled to restitution,"" O'Keefe said. That means that for some people, the only option is to go to court. Paralegal Keith Shaw has had several cases of car buyers trying to recoup their losses in small claims court over the last few years, and called it a less-than-ideal solution. ""It's costly, it's very stressful, and usually people who've purchased a car like this need that car to get to work,"" Shaw said. ""It's extremely tough on them."" Shaw said both customers and dealers — who are already paying into OMVIC — would benefit if disputes could be handled out of court. ""It would be so much better if the [council] had a little bit more punch in their glove, a little bit more bite."" It's up to the government to give OMVIC the power to force dealers who break the rules to compensate customers, said O'Keefe. Until that happens, his best advice is that prospective buyers get their vehicles thoroughly inspected before they buy them. ""That $150 and three or four hours that you spend — it could prevent some serious serious headaches down the road,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/omvic-car-buyer-protection-1.5425552,[],[]

367,Adam Miller,2020-01-18T09:00:00.516Z,Why flu season could make it harder for doctors to diagnose vaping-related illness,"A 20-year-old man shows up in a U.S. emergency room with flu-like symptoms.  He's hospitalized for four days before leaving, against medical advice, only to return to the ER with chest pain, fever and shortness of breath.  By this point he's lost almost 20 pounds. Doctors are stumped. They test him for strep throat, hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases, all of which turn up negative.  It's only when a camera is inserted into his airway and a CT scan is done to examine his lungs that it's confirmed he has vaping-related illness. The case, published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians this week, highlights the challenges in diagnosing vaping-related illness — especially during flu season. Canada is currently facing an early start to flu season, with both influenza A and B strains circulating at the same time.  So far, there have been nearly 12,500 confirmed cases of flu across the country and 10 deaths.  Dr. Tereza Martinu, a lung transplant respirologist with Toronto General Hospital who treated an Ontario teen with vaping-related illness last year, said diagnosing it can be difficult for doctors at this time of year. ""It always looks like something else,"" she said, adding that pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and the flu have similar symptoms. ""I think doctors don't think about it, and therefore often don't diagnose it.""  Martinu said it's important for doctors to be aware of vaping-related illness, particularly during flu season, and to ask patients about their exposure to vaping in order to rule it out. ""I think it's important to increase our awareness of it,"" she said. ""You need to then at least think about it and ask the right questions such as: Does the patient have exposure to vaping?""  Dr. Atul Kapur, an Ottawa-based emergency room doctor and co-chair of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians' public affairs committee, says it adds another layer of difficulty for diagnosis.  ""Having this as another potential cause of lung problems makes things busier and more difficult in the emergency department,"" he said. ""From our point of view, that's a big problem.""  There have been 2,668 reported cases of vaping-related illness in the U.S. and 60 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Canada has had just 16 cases and no deaths in the same time period, a disproportionately low number even with our smaller population. Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s chief medical officer and chair of the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health, said she's surprised by the lower number of cases in Canada.  She says it may have something to do with the differences in the availability of legal and illegal products, or how it's diagnosed.  The CDC reports that 82 per cent of cases in the U.S. reported using any cannabis vapes, while 57 per cent said they used any nicotine e-cigarettes. Of those, 33 per cent reported exclusively using cannabis vapes, while 14 per cent said they had only vaped nicotine.  In Canada, nine of the 16 cases reported vaping nicotine exclusively. Three said they had vaped cannabis and nicotine, and another three reported vaping cannabis only.  An additive called vitamin E acetate has been identified as a ""chemical of concern"" by the CDC in the outbreak of the illness, but has not officially been confirmed as the culprit.   ""I think it's way too early to identify a clear pattern,"" says Dr. Martin Kolb, director of the respirology division at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. ""I think what that clearly shows us is that these products are not harmless in a way that it was shown and continues to be described by the industry."" ""It absolutely is under-reported,"" said Henry. ""We are going to absolutely miss some and it's a challenge — it's a diagnostic challenge for clinicians that we face all the time."" She said the difficulty is that the diagnosis relies on a doctor asking questions specifically about vaping and patients being upfront about their use.  Kapur, with the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, says it can also take time for a team of experts to identify the illness. ""There is going to be a bit of a delay before people are making the link and ruling out other causes,"" he said. ""The problem with this, of course, is that they get worse fairly quickly.""  Kapur said patients will often quit vaping when symptoms persist, adding another challenge, which is what happened in the U.S. case study.  ""Because the symptoms are of breathing, a lot of patients are probably stopping on their own,"" Kapur said. ""And so there may be some milder cases that aren't connected at all. So that would account for some under-reporting in both countries."" That decision to quit vaping during treatment could also lead to a misdiagnosis, Martinu said.  ""If the patient stops using it and improves, then we may have diagnosed some of those problems as something that is much more common,"" she said.  Henry said there may be people with milder, undiagnosed cases in the community that are unknown to health officials who could be at risk of severe influenza or other viral illnesses circulating this time of year.  ""I have no doubt that there are some people hospitalized and it is likely either exacerbated or related to their vaping that we don't know about,"" said Henry.  ""That's why it's so important to get these messages out, particularly for young people about the issues that can come up with vaping and why it's not a good thing to do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-pneumonia-1.5428093 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illnesses-1.5386125 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-vitamin-e-1.5404858 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-liquid-tests-1.5381363 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/vaping-lung-transplant-1.5359105,/news/health/flu-pneumonia-1.5428093 /news/health/vaping-vitamin-e-1.5404858 /news/health/vaping-illnesses-1.5386125

370,Alicia Bridges and Victoria Dinh,2019-12-09T11:00:00.517Z,Confessions and controversy: Murder case against husband of Sheree Fertuck latest test of 'Mr. Big' tactic,"There's a big-time crime boss in Canada who treats his loyal followers to expensive dinners, gives them jobs and cleans up their crimes to keep them out of jail.  But the crimes aren't real, nor are the jobs. They're an elaborate ruse set up by the police to gather evidence from people suspected of serious crimes. A Saskatchewan man accused of murdering his estranged wife is the latest Canadian to find himself behind bars at the hands of ""Mr. Big"": the name given to a controversial undercover police tactic that law enforcement agencies across the country have used in efforts to move cold cases forward.  The operations involve police posing as criminals in an attempt to obtain a confession from a suspect. According to police, Greg Fertuck told an undercover officer that he ""got rid of"" his estranged wife, Sheree Fertuck, and threw her in the bush. She has been missing since her semi-truck was found abandoned at a gravel pit near Kenaston, Sask., in December 2015. Although her body has never been found, Greg Fertuck was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in late June 2019. Sheree's disappearance is the focus of a seven-part CBC investigative podcast called The Pit, the culmination of a year-long effort to uncover new information about the case. Now, as he sits behind bars in Saskatoon, charged with first-degree murder, Greg Fertuck is proclaiming his innocence. He said he lied about getting rid of Sheree because he was scared and intimidated by the undercover officers, who he says he believed were criminals. ""I made it up, and we went out supposedly looking for the body. Well, there is no body, so we just drove around to these different places, because it was all BS,"" said Fertuck in an interview with CBC News. ""I didn't kill her and there was no body out there."" Fertuck's claim goes straight to the heart of the controversy over the Mr. Big technique. Critics say it can violate the principles of confession law by creating a culture of fear, and may heighten the risk of false confessions. There have also been accusations it preys on the vulnerabilities of suspects with financial problems or addictions.   But for families of victims whose cases have gone cold, Mr. Big stings can be the only way to see charges laid and justice for their loved ones.  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, is happy to see progress on the case.  ""I think because they are controversial I'm really crossing my fingers and hoping that [the RCMP] did it all the right ways, and did it legally … so that it can be admissible in court,"" she said.  ""You get one kick at the cat, right? So I really think that they know what they are doing.""  The playing field for Mr. Big stings is evolving under new guidelines outlined by a Supreme Court decision in 2014.   Still, questions remain about how the courts should balance the rights of the accused with the need for police to have the tools to catch violent criminals. CBC contacted the Saskatchewan RCMP but spokesperson Rob King said the police service will not discuss the technique or address criticisms of the method, because it is still being used.  Mr. Big stings have been carried out hundreds of times in Canada since they were developed by the RCMP in the 1990s, often in elaborate operations — some have cost more than $300,000 to run.  The tactic is not used in the U.S. or Britain, but it has been used to produce charges in Australia. In the stings, officers befriend a suspect while pretending to be members of a fictitious crime organization.  The goal is to build trust with the target and potentially draw out new information to use as evidence. This could include a confession to a crime, a description of how the crime occurred, or the location of the victim's body or the murder weapon.  The method is often used in cold cases, where the police have a suspect but lack the evidence to prosecute.  Saskatoon defence lawyer Brian Pfefferle has represented three people charged with separate serious crimes after a Mr. Big sting.  He said the technique is highly successful in landing convictions.  ""I've never been able to convince a jury that there was a false confession made. And I think my results are consistent with other people's results around the country,"" said Pfefferle.  ""There's a smattering of cases that have led to acquittals or convictions on lower offences but for the most part they're getting convicted of the offence they're facing when they're giving these types of confessions, so it's very significant evidence."" Each of the operations follows a similar script: the undercover agents insert themselves into the target's lives through a ""chance"" meeting, and bring them further into the ""organization"" through a chain of scenarios.  In an interview at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre in July, Fertuck shared details of the operation with CBC.  He said an undercover officer offered him paid jobs transporting vehicles from one town to another. Paid work is regularly offered to Mr. Big suspects during the course of the sting, and Fertuck said he trusted the men. It's common for the suspect to feel a strong kinship with the undercover officers in the stings, says Pfefferle. ""They become real friends,"" he said.  ""I've had situations where the people 'fall in love,' essentially, with the various characters — not in a romantic sense but in a friendship sense, where ... oftentimes the best friends they've ever had in their life are these fictitious friends."" Fertuck also described another hallmark of the Mr. Big method: a scenario known as ""the violent incident.""  He said he met with a man who appeared to have committed a killing — and another man who said he would clean it up. ""This one guy [said he] killed his girlfriend, and I know he had blood all over him, scratches on his face,"" said Fertuck.  ""And this guy from Vancouver ... come in and got rid of everything, sort of the clean-up guy."" Some type of simulated violence is part of most Mr. Big stings. During a 2015 appeal of a first-degree murder conviction, the officer who directed an undercover operation involving murder suspect Jesse West explained the reason for choosing to simulate violence against a woman as part of the sting: ""It was directly to show Mr. West that violence against women was accepted in our organization. The investigation was a homicide on a female and we wanted to show him that women — to conduct violence on women is not a big deal."" In that case, the judge denied the defence claim that the violent incident was an abuse of process, and the appeal of West's conviction was dismissed. In the case of Abiram Subramaniam, who was convicted in 2016 of second-degree murder in Quebec, the ""criminals"" told the suspect they had information that police were coming after him.  The details are part of a written decision by Justice Marc-Andre Blanchard.  ""The Boss was willing to … help him get out of this situation related to the victim,"" Justice Blanchard wrote. ""Without his help, it was made clear that Subramaniam would in all likelihood be going to jail for 25 years."" Pfefferle said he considers confession evidence such as that from Mr. Big stings even more damning for the accused than video evidence. His main concerns about the technique relate to confession law, which states that a confession must be made of free will and without any threats or promises made to the accused.  ""The problem with Mr. Bigs, at their core, is that they are based on exactly those things — not necessarily direct threats, but there is this subtle threat of this organization being pretty bad."" There are also promises, Pfefferle said. ""Oftentimes it's promises for a long-term job with the criminal organization, and many times these particular accused persons will have difficulty with employment."" He said Mr. Big stings are also different from traditional police investigations because most of the interactions are not recorded.  Usually when a person is arrested, all of their interactions with police in the interview room are recorded. In Mr. Big stings, usually only the final interview, or a handful of meetings, are taped. But Pfefferle also sees broader issues with the way the stings operate. Although there is evidence that false confessions have occurred, he said society has a tendency to believe an admission of guilt.  ""If you've confessed to something, especially something that is embarrassing or it's going to get you in trouble, most people believe you did it,"" said Pfefferle.  ""I think that's one of the problems with Mr. Bigs because the evidence at the end of the day is so strong in the minds of the average juror that they're going to say 'he wouldn't have confessed if he didn't do it.'"" People have been cleared of committing crimes they confessed to during a Mr. Big sting.  Kyle Unger spent 14 years in jail for the murder of Brigitte Grenier in Manitoba in 1990.  He was convicted based largely on his confession, testimony from jailhouse informants and a single piece of forensic evidence — a hair found on the victim's clothing.  But DNA testing later proved the hair did not belong to Unger. And although he got key facts wrong about the killing in his confession to undercover officers, it was still used against him.  He later told reporters he'd lied because he was young, naive and desperate for money. Unger was acquitted in 2009.  Al Haslett, a retired RCMP officer and one of the creators of the Mr. Big sting, previously defended the technique in an interview with CBC's The Fifth Estate in 2015. ""[We] seek the truth. We don't go there, we don't wake up in the morning and say 'we're going to get confessions,'"" Haslett said in an interview with Bob McKeown.   ""This is not a bunch of cowboy cops going out and doing this. This is planned, the scenarios are planned, thought out, and we go to seek the truth."" Haslett was not available to be interviewed by CBC for this story. However, ""things can go off the rails and people can, because of fear, say and do things that might not otherwise be true, or that they might not otherwise have done,"" said Neil Boyd, the director of the school of criminology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. But he pointed to the case of Doug Holtam as an example of a case where a Mr. Big sting led to a conviction that was warranted.  Holtam was convicted of the 1997 murder of his wife Leonora and six-year-old daughter with a hammer. He was also found guilty of the attempted murder of his son, who survived the attack. Police had DNA evidence of his children's blood on his shirt and shoe before the Mr. Big sting led to a confession.  ""His conviction was entirely warranted, so I don't take the position that just because the police have engaged in this kind of activity that it's necessarily suspect,"" said Boyd.  It is up to the courts to decide if a case has gone ""off the rails"" or not, he said. That's what the Supreme Court did in 2014, when the case of Nelson Hart in Newfoundland led to stricter rules for Mr. Big stings. The court concluded the conduct of police in that case was ""egregious"" and ""troubling."" Justice Michael Moldaver wrote that the law at that time didn't offer enough protection to people who confessed to crimes during Mr. Bigs.  He said while these types of stings can produce valuable evidence and are not necessarily abusive, they can become abusive and produce unreliable confessions. He ruled police should be allowed to keep using the tactic, but under stricter rules.  Mr. Big confessions are now automatically considered inadmissible unless the Crown can prove their value as evidence outweighs their capacity to prejudice the outcome of trial. Prosecutors have successfully done so in several cases since 2014.  The 2014 Supreme Court decision also offered clearer guidelines for judges deciding if Mr. Big evidence should be admissible, and to help them decide what counts as police misconduct.  The Public Prosecution Service of Canada wrote about the impact of the case against Hart in a 2018 report titled Innocence at Stake: The Need for Continued Vigilance to Prevent Wrongful Convictions in Canada. The report predicted the courts will likely be more restrictive about what types of violent incidents can be simulated in Mr. Big stings in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. It offered recommendations for prosecution services, urging them to make sure they do not exploit the target's vulnerabilities, and to take further care to ensure the violent incident does not directly or indirectly threaten the suspect.  Juries at Mr. Big trials are also now instructed that people have falsely confessed in the past.   Brian Pfefferle said the legitimacy of the confession will likely be at the heart of the Crown's case against Greg Fertuck.  ""The strength of that confession is really going to be the focus for the jury, as it always is,"" said Pfefferle.  ""What can be corroborated through the forensic evidence?""  Another factor in the Fertuck case will be the fact that Sheree's body has not been found. It is unusual for police to lay charges without finding the victim.  Greg Fertuck said he led the undercover officers to a country road outside Saskatoon. In the days after his June arrest, police were seen searching an area not far from the gravel pit where Sheree's truck was found, but they did not find her remains.  RCMP Insp. Diane Cockle says searching for human remains that have been left outside for four years is an incredibly difficult task.  ""What happens to the remains is they get weathered, they change colour, they get bleached by the sun or they get stained by the soil,"" said Cockle, who has a PhD in forensic anthropology and worked as a forensic crime scene investigator for 19 years. She now works in major crimes.  ""The vegetation gets deposited on top of the area over time so they end up being buried. And it becomes less and less visible every year."" Scavengers including domestic dogs, coyotes and birds can move parts of a body up to about 400-500 metres from where the body was dumped, she said. ""But if these guys [in Saskatchewan] were searching in a systematic matter looking for things like small bone fragments and they knew what they were looking for, chances are they would have found what they were looking for."" On June 25, the day after Greg Fertuck's arrest, the search for Sheree Fertuck was still ongoing when RCMP Supt. Derek Williams announced the charges.  ""Although it's unusual, there have been successful prosecutions before without a body being found,"" said Williams.  A preliminary hearing will be held in January to decide if there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. The hearing is likely to be subject to a publication ban.  To date, Greg Fertuck has been represented by Saskatoon criminal defence lawyer Morris Bodnar.  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, hopes to attend the upcoming court proceedings, although she fears the evidence will be difficult to hear. Regardless, she is relieved to see the progress from a police perspective. ""I was a little bit afraid that, you know, cases do go cold, right. You hear that all the time. And I just thought, 'Oh God … this can't be one of them. Something's gotta come of it.'""  The preliminary hearing begins on Jan. 13.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mr-big-sting-saskatchewan-greg-fertuck-rcmp-police-canada-1.5388277,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/greg-fertuck-denies-killing-sheree-fertuck-1.5212297 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/friend-remembers-sheree-fertuck-at-accused-killer-s-court-appearance-in-saskatoon-1.5220735 https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2014-2015/mrbig https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kyle-unger-lawsuit-settled-1.5115948 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mr-big-ruling-a-game-changer-for-those-convicted-in-sting-operations-1.2724310,/news/politics/mr-big-sting-confessions-get-stricter-rules-from-supreme-court-1.2723690 /news/canada/montreal/ismael-habib-day-16-1.4019335 /news/canada/manitoba/raymond-cormier-conversation-with-cbc-1.4546319 /news/canada/saskatoon/accused-killer-david-caissie-will-learn-fate-in-saskatoon-courtroom-1.4965926 /news/canada/british-columbia/skiffington-mr-big-rcmp-murder-wanda-lee-martin-richmond-newfoundland-2nd-degree-1.4970006 /news/canada/calgary/kyle-ledesma-dexter-bain-murder-trial-defence-1.5006902 /news/canada/saskatoon/friend-remembers-sheree-fertuck-at-accused-killer-s-court-appearance-in-saskatoon-1.5220735 /news/canada/saskatoon/sisters-sheree-fertuck-fourth-anniversary-disappearance-greg-fertuck-trial-court-1.5385483
371,Shanifa Nasser,2020-01-17T14:10:11.222Z,"A young man dies while on suicide watch, but there's no courtroom in Toronto to hear the case","For nearly seven years, one thing has kept Rakesh Tiwari from performing funeral rites for his son: an answer to how his boy could have taken his own life while he was in a hospital psychiatric unit under suicide watch. ""I didn't want to let him go just like that,"" Tiwari said. That answer was supposed to emerge during a wrongful death lawsuit against the William Osler Health System's Brampton Civic Hospital. The family filed the $12.5 million suit in 2015 and has been waiting for its day in court ever since. But now, Tiwari will have to wait even longer to bid his son goodbye. The reason: there isn't a single courtroom available in the Toronto area to hear Prashant Tiwari's case. It's a problem Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General acknowledges outright, saying it is working with its legal partners to find ways to address the delays and backlogs within the province's justice system. A recent report by provincial Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk found Ontario courtrooms operated for only 2.8 hours on an average businesses day, with nearly three-quarters of all courthouses reporting ""above-average"" delays. Tiwari can still remember the day Prashant came to him, self-inflicted wounds all over his neck and chest, telling his father he needed help. It was June 16, 2014. Tiwari did the one thing he thought he was supposed to do in that moment: take his son to the hospital. Ten days later, Prashant was dead — according to the lawsuit, the 20-year-old had hanged himself in the hospital's bathroom. He was allegedly left unattended for two hours and 40 minutes before staff found his body. Tiwari believed staff were supposed to check on his son every 15 minutes.  After his death, the statement of claim alleges, 12 people accessed Prashant's medical records without proper authorization for unknown reasons. None of the allegations has been proven in court. William Osler Health System, the organization that runs the hospital, has previously said, ""While we do not comment on an individual patient case, we have and continue to express our sincere condolences for the family's loss."" Just how a young man could have died by suicide when he was supposed to be under the watchful eye of hospital staff is the question that haunts Prashant's family.  On Jan. 8, 2020, they thought they would be able to begin answering that question. ""We were at the steps of the courthouse, we were ready to start the trial and frankly the hospital was ready,"" the family's lawyer Michael Smitiuch told CBC News. But once inside the courthouse, they learned there were no courtrooms — not in Brampton, Toronto, Milton, Kitchener or Orangeville — to hear the case until 2021. ""There's a saying, justice delayed is justice denied, and that's the case here,"" Smitiuch said. To prepare for the case, Tiwari and his other son, Gautam Tiwari, had to undertake the painful process of gathering all of Prashant's paperwork: photos, medical records, letters, all windows into the pain he was living through. ""So we're very vividly reliving the trauma,"" said Gautam. ""Then, when we're told we have to delay, it's like now we're going to have to go through all of this all over again a year from now."" Their lawyer acknowledges court staff and judges are doing their best under the constraints, but says much more funding needs to be allocated toward the justice system for it to deliver justice. ""Funding is crucial from the Ontario government,"" said Smitiuch. ""They need to throw more resources at the court system. We also need more judges — there's no doubt that there is a need for the federal appointment of judges."" As part of its efforts to help cut down on the backlog, the Ministry of the Attorney General says it has expanded access to a ""Simplified Procedure"" process. Starting Jan. 1, 2020, Ontarians with civil court claims up to $200,000 can use that expedited process, which the ministry hopes will result in reduced wait times. The Small Claims Court limit has also been increased to $35,000, which should see many civil cases diverted from the Superior Court, freeing up resources for other cases. ""With respect to criminal court delay, the right to be tried within a reasonable time is a fundamental part of our justice system,"" ministry spokesperson Brian Gray said in a statement. But while the auditor general flagged the delays in access to justice in her 2019 report, she also highlighted a lack of data that would have provided a clearer picture of just how deep the problem runs. ""During our audit, we experienced significant scope limitations in our access to key information related to court scheduling ... As a result, we were unable to assess whether public resources, such as courtrooms, are scheduled and used optimally to help reduce delays,"" the report said. This year, when Prashant should have turned 27, Tiwari is left wondering if he'll ever see justice for his son. Not only does he feel let down by the medical system, but by the court system too. ""It's delay after delay,"" he said. ""I'm losing hope inside my head and my heart. ""How many more lives have to be lost?""

372,Connie Walker,2019-11-06T13:27:03.669Z,Shooting death of young Indigenous man forces rural community to confront racism,"In many ways, Kristian Ayoungman was seen as an example of reconciliation in action. He lived on the Siksika First Nation, but growing up, he went to school and played hockey in Strathmore, Alta., a small town 20 kilometres north of the reserve.  He was seen as a bridge between the two communities in which he lived — until the night in March when he was shot and killed. A couple of days later, two men from Strathmore were charged with first degree murder in the 24-year-old's death.  ""My son was a very, very good kid, and well loved and liked by everybody,"" said Melodie Ayoungman, Kristian's mother. ""And the reality behind it is, it was an act of racism that took his life. And that's hard for me to comprehend."" Ayoungman said she believes her son's death was the result of racism, because of what happened in the hours before the shooting. Kristian, a champion pow-wow dancer on the reserve, was also a hockey star in town. On March 17, he played in an alumni hockey game in Strathmore. Kristian and his friends Brooker Prettyyoungman, Ryley McMaster and Breanna Crawler went to a local pub after the game. They say at the end of the night an exchange with strangers outside the bar led to a fight that was peppered with racial slurs.  ""He was like just calling me names, and he told me 'to go back to the f--king reserve you f--king dirty Indians … get the f--k out of here,'"" Crawler said.  She added that she didn't know the man who yelled at her, but now believes it was Kody Giffen, one of the men charged with Ayoungman's murder.  ""I was looking at him and I was like, 'Are you serious? Like, don't talk to me like that.' I'm like, that's racist, right?"" Crawler, McMaster and Prettyyoungman say the altercation didn't last long and the two groups separated. They ran into each other again shortly afterwards, but this time, they say the group of men was larger and they had weapons. Crawler said when she and her friends saw a gun, they got into their truck and tried to leave. They said the men got into another vehicle and chased them out of town. Crawler was driving the truck and headed toward Siksika when she heard a gunshot.  ""I looked in the rear-view mirror. And by that time, that white car was behind me ... I seen it stop in like five seconds, it was like really fast. We heard a shot,"" Crawler said. ""I felt something on my back … and I was thinking, like, I was thinking to myself did I get shot? Did I get shot? …. And then Kristian said, 'They got me, bro. They got me.'"" Ayoungman had been shot. His friends got him out of the truck, and he died on the side of the road south of Strathmore. Prettyyoungman and Crawler didn't see where the shot came from or who fired the gun that killed Ayoungman. Two days later on March 19, Kody Giffen, 22, and his brother Brandon, 25, — both from Strathmore — were charged with first degree murder. Brandon Giffen is in custody and Kody Giffen was granted bail in August. Both are scheduled to appear in court in the new year.  CBC News reached out to both for comment, but they declined through their lawyers. Although the trial of the brothers is several months away, some in the community are drawing parallels to the high-profile death of Colten Boushie, a young Indigenous man shot and killed by a white man in rural Saskatchewan in 2016. Unlike Boushie, Ayoungman's death received very little media attention. In the immediate aftermath of his death, avoiding the media was part of a strategy by Ayoungman's family and Siksika leadership to keep racial tensions from escalating.  Buck Breaker, a councillor on the Siksika First Nation, said he worried that if they didn't handle the situation carefully, more violence would follow. ""I'll make reference to the Colton Boushie tragedy — we didn't want to, like I said, cause any more animosity than was already there. A lot of our people were angry, and still are. But you know, we had to be careful on what we say,"" Breaker said.  ""A lot of the tension is on social media, Facebook or whatever, so we didn't want that to escalate to the point where our young people would go into Strathmore and take more action. If that was what would have happened — the jail cells would have been full and the morgue would have been full and the courthouse would have been full."" Melodie Ayoungman was pivotal in helping to keep people calm. She set the tone for how both communities would respond to Ayoungman's death. Instead of turning to anger, she turned to her Blackfoot culture and the teachings from her grandparents and called for peace between the two communities.  ""My son's life was taken in the wrong way, but this isn't the way we're going to deal with it. Not with revenge. We weren't taught like that,"" she said. The situation was so tense, Melodie Ayoungman heard that people from the reserve, including Prettyoungman and Crawler, were worried about going into Strathmore after Kristian's death.  ""They were traumatized,"" Ayoungman said. ""I didn't want our community to be afraid or feel scared. [I wanted] to show them, 'No, you can keep your head up. Be proud of who you are. Be proud of where you come from.  We belong here.'"" Ayoungman organized a candlelight vigil. People from her community travelled from Siksika into Strathmore, where they were met by dozens of people in town to honour her son. Strathmore mayor Pat Fule was among them. He's a longtime resident in Strathmore and a former teacher. Following the vigil, he took an unusual step that he said upset some residents of the predominantly white town. He wrote a letter in the local paper, admitting there was racism in Strathmore and called on people to confront it directly. He wrote: ""Until we can admit that racism is here — and due to the recent murder, our neighbours now worry about coming to Strathmore — we can't improve."" Fule said there was a mixed reaction to his letter, but that it was an important step to building a better relationship between the two communities. ""I was worried about the controversy … but sometimes you have to do the right thing even if the right thing is the most painful or difficult thing to do. And so I decided I would do that."" Since Ayoungman's death last spring, Siksika and Strathmore leadership have been holding regular meetings — something that had never happened before, even though the two communities have been been neighbours for more than 100 years. Outside of school or sports, Mayor Fule said there was very little interaction between the two communities. ""Now, I'm saying hi to a First Nations person I run into at a store where maybe before I would [not]. I would not be rude or anything, but you just get comfortable in not doing things, you just interact silently,"" said Mayor Fule. ""And so I'm reaching out a little more, I'm holding doors, I'm saying hi."" It's too early to say whether the efforts of the community leaders will lead to reconciliation. The steps are small and the progress is slow, but Melodie Ayoungman has big hopes. She wants her son's tragic death to be a wake-up call for her community and others like it.  ""I hope that this can change the future for First Nations, because there's so much injustice towards First Nations and times need to change.

373,Erica Johnson,2019-11-04T18:23:16.606Z,Seniors' home confines 94-year-old blind woman to bedbug-infested room for 2 weeks,"Rita Bedford, 94, was kept confined to her apartment in a Chilliwack, B.C., senior care home for two weeks last December over the holidays — while bedbugs multiplied on her mattress. She is blind, and a staffer alleged in emails to provincial authorities that employees of The Cascades facility were ordered not to tell Bedford what was happening. But, so disturbed by what she saw, the staffer took photos. Another took video — capturing bedbugs scurrying across Bedford's mattress, bloodstains, and bedbug carcasses on the floor. They sent the images to Bedford's daughter in Ottawa, early in the New Year.  ""I couldn't believe my eyes,"" said Anne-Marie Burgon, recalling how she played the video several times, trying to absorb what she was seeing. ""I'm so grateful that [the employees] were willing to stand up for their beliefs, for doing the right thing, the moral thing."" ""I could not believe that a facility in Canada … would allow something so hideous to happen."" Infuriating, yes, but ""not shocking,"" said Amani Oakley, a Toronto-area lawyer who has battled nursing home chains for over two decades, and who currently has several lawsuits underway against Cascades owner Sienna Senior Living, formerly Leisureworld.  ""I'm infuriated that we still are allowing these corporations to make money off our seniors … while delivering shoddy care,"" Oakley said. Burgon was first contacted on Dec. 20, 2018 by the Cascades head nurse, who was filling in for the vacationing executive director. She says she was told that a resident living next to her mother had brought bedbugs into the facility and that a single bedbug had been found on Bedford's bed. ""I assumed they knew what they were doing,"" said Burgon. ""I thought it would be not much of a big deal."" But according to a timeline the home later provided to health authorities, employees had, on Dec. 19, found ""10 small bite marks"" on Bedford's back and arms, ""blood spots"" on her bed and ""five possible bed bugs"" on her floor.  Staff were told to ""wash and change"" Bedford, and a pest control company was brought in, though only the apartment next to hers was heat-treated and vacuumed, according to the timeline. In Bedford's apartment, an ant trap was placed between her mattress and box spring.  After two weeks, on Jan. 2, a Cascades employee complained to regulators with the Ministry of Health, reporting she and her colleagues were being instructed to keep Bedford confined to her room. ""Please help,"" the employee wrote in an email. ""It's inhumane.""  She claimed management told staff to lie to Bedford — that she was sick and couldn't visit with friends or share Christmas dinner with other residents. She also alleged management threatened to fire any staff who spoke publicly or to other residents about the outbreak.  ""I just can't do it any longer,"" the employee wrote, calling Bedford a ""blood buffet.""  ""This woman is 94 and blind. Locked in a room, being chewed up while management hides it."" That same day staff moved Bedford and her neighbour to new suites. Management later claimed, in the timeline, that they didn't have other rooms available until then. An employee secretly described what her mother had endured over the holidays, Burgon says. ""I was told of her crying and asking repeatedly, 'Are these bugs crawling on my skin?'"" she said. ""It broke my heart ... I felt betrayed.""  Around then, Cascades executive director Rob White returned from vacation.  Burgon says he told her that Sienna did not know how to handle the bedbug outbreak and says he repeatedly complained to her about the cost of dealing with it. ""I had to listen to his concerns about how expensive this was and how much time it was taking him away from his job,"" Burgon said.  White did not respond to Go Public's request for an interview. Oakley, the lawyer, says she hears so many complaints of neglect and abuse involving Canada's three largest for-profit seniors' homes that last year, she filed a proposed class-action lawsuit involving 200 families. The lawsuit named Extendicare, which runs 96 homes across the country; Sienna, which operates 83; and Revera, which runs 76.  Oakley alleged the companies were ""systematically negligent"" but the Ontario Superior Court of Justice discontinued the lawsuit, says Oakley, because the cases were too dissimilar.  She is instead pursuing dozens of individual lawsuits on behalf of the families. None of the allegations has been proven in court and all three companies deny the allegations have merit.  Oakley says because privately owned chains receive provincial subsidies for some clients, government oversight needs to be rigorous. ""Part of the problem is that [government] inspections tend to be announced,"" said Oakley. ""So they [long-term care chains] know when the inspectors are coming, weeks ahead of time."" Go Public asked several provinces whether their inspections are announced or unexpected.  Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario said some inspections are not announced, while others are and happen every one to two years — more often if a complaint is reported or a problem found. Nova Scotia said all inspections are unannounced and happen at least twice a year. Inspections in B.C. were previously only triggered by complaints. New legislation that takes effect Dec. 1 allows inspections at any time.  But even when problems are discovered — Oakley says many homes are understaffed, and she often hears of one nurse being in charge of 60 people at nighttime —  getting justice can be a challenge. She says the courts don't place much value on the lives of elderly people who are no longer working. ""I've been told by a judge that I'm wasting his time because the case is [financially] modest,"" she said.  Sienna Senior Living is a publicly-traded company worth $1.25 billion in 2018. Complaints to regulators from staff and Burgon led to an investigation and two reports in May and in June, which found Cascades violated regulations including not providing a ""safe and sanitary environment"" and not protecting residents by responding in a timely manner to allegations of ""abuse and neglect."" The site was also found to not have sufficient staffing levels. As of last week, the home was still ""not in full compliance"" with health and safety standards, according to a Ministry of Health spokesperson, who added that officials had a recent meeting with Sienna to discuss outstanding issues and to ensure the company keeps working toward ""full compliance."" Cascades management apologized in a letter to the family for the ""housekeeping inadequacies, miscommunications … and the overall experience."" Sienna Senior Living declined an interview request by Go Public, sending a statement that said the company regrets what happened.  ""Our goal is to provide all tenants with the best possible quality service and overall retirement living experience through the warmth of human connection,"" wrote a spokesperson. ""We recognized that there were actions that should have been better."" ""We have apologized and worked with the tenant and family to resolve their concerns."" The spokesperson would not say why Bedford was left in her room for two weeks, nor comment on a staffer's allegation that management threatened to fire any staffers. Burgon decided it would be too disorienting to move her mother — who turned 95 in February — to another nursing home. She's worried that speaking out about the care her mom received will bring repercussions, but says she wants Sienna held accountable. ""You trust that they're [Sienna] going to uphold their part of — not even the legal contract, but the social and moral contract,"" says Burgon. ""I'm appalled at how callous they were.""

374,Anonymous,2020-01-18T14:00:00.422Z,Trapper recounts 'rough experience' stranded in Yukon bush for a week at -45 C,"Tyrell Ollie learned a hard lesson last week, after a trip to his remote trapping cabin in Yukon turned into a week-long struggle to survive the bitter cold. ""It taught me not to rush,"" said Ollie. ""Take your time, and make sure you have everything you need."" Ollie, it turned out, didn't have what he needed when he set out from Ross River, Yukon, by snowmobile with his cousin Rebecca Johnny, on Jan. 5. The plan was to check Ollie's traps and stay at his cabin at Dragon Lake, north of Ross River — but a snowmobile breakdown left them stranded partway there. ""I just didn't have the right tools. I had my tools, but it wasn't the right ones to take the [snowmobile's] chaincase off,"" he recalled. They were about 80 kilometres from Ross River, up the Canol Road, and still about 23 kilometres from Dragon Lake. The temperature, already below –20 C when they set out was soon pushing –45 C.   ""It got really cold on us. Three, four hours — just dropped."" Remarkably, there was a lifeline nearby — another of Ollie's trapping cabins. It didn't have the supplies and firewood that the Dragon Lake cabin had, but it was shelter. ""I cut wood and set rabbit snares and I just tried to be in a survival mode I learned from my elders,"" Ollie said. ""I tried not to get scared out there, just trying to be strong and take care of my cousin Rebecca, mostly."" They ended up staying for days, trying to keep warm while figuring out what to do. At one point, they tried walking back to Ross River. They slogged for a few kilometres before stopping under a tree to make a fire. They stayed two days and reconsidered their plan. ""I looked at the moon, and I seen that moon dog [lunar halo], and I was like, 'no way we'll make it, going back,'"" Ollie said.  ""So we turned around to the cabin and we hunkered down there and we stayed there,"" Ollie said.  By the end of the week, people in Ross River were worried. The two cousins were reported overdue to police and other local officials. ""[Ollie] and I always talk trapping and we have a pretty good relationship,"" said Tynan Thurmer, the district conservation officer for Ross River. ""So you know, as soon as I heard he was overdue, and the area he traps is so remote and harsh, you know, I was pretty gung-ho to get out there and help him."" Thurmer joined RCMP officers as they set off on snowmobiles on Saturday evening, for Dragon Lake. They made it about a third of the way there, Thurmer said. ""Given the temperatures, it was pushing 50 below zero and machines and equipment weren't working properly — so we had to turn back."" The next day, they secured a helicopter out of Whitehorse and flew directly to Dragon Lake. Thurmer's heart sank when he saw Ollie's cabin. ""It was quite evident that when we landed, no one had been there in days. You know, there was six inches of fresh snow, the cabin door was completely blown in. ""So then we thought, OK, they never made it.""  Down the trail, huddled in the other small cabin, Ollie and Johnny were doing what they could to stay warm and keep their strength up.    They had little dry firewood on hand, and no saw, so they used an axe to cut green trees — and tried not to smoke themselves out. One of the cabin's wooden beds was hacked up to feed the fire. ""We looked for every wood we could find,"" Ollie said.   They ate what little they had — some eggs, potatoes and onions. Ollie shot a grouse and they made broth. They drank NeoCitran to keep warm, he said. Ollie saw a moose one day, across a beaver pond, but he felt too weak to shoot it and skin it and get it back to the cabin. He also didn't trust the ice on the beaver pond.  When it was Johnny's 24th birthday, they spent the day dreaming about food. ""We just sat there and talked about pineapples and oranges and that,"" Ollie said. Leaving Dragon Lake, the rescue team decided to search the whole area from the chopper. ""I was just going off my knowledge of, you know, every cabin that I've been to along the road, and every area that Tyrell mentioned to me that he might be trapping out of,"" Thurmer said. Partway back to Ross River, they saw them — two figures standing on the trail below. ""We saw them waving,"" Thurmer said. ""I was quite relieved."" Ollie and Johnny were picked up and taken back to Ross River. Ollie said they were checked out for any injuries. ""Everything was OK, it was just my big toe and my fingertips was kind of cold,"" he said. Thurmer is being lauded for his rescue efforts. Yukon's chief conservation officer Gordon Hitchcock has awarded him a Chief's Commendation — Award of Merit, for ""meritorious service in the face of extreme conditions."" ""[Conservation officer] Thurmer's actions were directly related to the successful rescue,"" Hitchcock said in a statement. Ollie is grateful for the rescue, and relieved that he and Johnny are home safe. He says he'll never head out again in such cold weather. ""I'm very happy to see family and friends. I wish this would never happen to any other person, because it's a pretty rough experience, I tell you that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-trappers-resuce-ross-river-1.5428201,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/survival-story-missing-man-boy-igloolik-hall-beach-1.4419091 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-vehicle-set-fire-cold-1.5428598 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-mushroom-picker-story-1.4197175,/news/canada/north/rescued-boater-kakisa-lake-nwt-1.5150118 /news/canada/north/yukon-vehicle-set-fire-cold-1.5428598 /news/canada/north/yukon-bison-attack-todd-pilgrim-1.4398582
375,Anonymous,2020-01-19T18:09:05.519Z,"Vape shop, beauty salon destroyed in 'horrific' Glace Bay fire","Dozens of firefighters spent Saturday evening battling a fire that destroyed a two-storey building that housed two businesses and some vacant apartments in Glace Bay, N.S.  John Chant, chief of the Glace Bay Volunteer Fire Department, said someone working in one of the businesses called the fire department around 6:20 p.m. Saturday complaining of smoke in the building.  Not long after, he said a call came in from a passerby saying the building was engulfed in flames.  ""So the fire was very fast travelling,"" he said. ""It was horrific,"" said Walter Burgess, part owner of Coastal Vapor, who was inside with a customer when the fire broke out. ""[It] just boggles my mind how fast it was. I literally had a ceiling come down on me, that's how fast it happened. I'm actually lucky that I even got out. Couldn't see the hand in front of my face,"" Burgess said. The building on the corner of Commercial and Catherine streets was home to Coastal Vapor, Bel's Beauty Boutique and Cash Corner. The apartments above weren't occupied, said Chant. By 10 p.m. the fire was under control, but Chant said the building was a ""total loss.""  He said they called in an excavator to tear down what was left of it so they could attack hotspots. Crews were expected to be on site for much of the night.  Six departments and roughly 50 firefighters were involved in fighting the blaze, as well as two aerial fire trucks. He said it's too early to know the cause, but police have been called in to investigate. No one was hurt in the fire, but Chant said frigid temperatures made conditions difficult for firefighters.  ""Everything is frozen solid.

Organizers with the biannual showcase said by email they've decided ""to pause"" the event ""in order to rethink the platform."" No reasons were given. A statement on Twitter from @TOFashionWK says organizers will focus on ""how best to engage the industry, support designers and resonate with consumers.""  They add that they remain ""steadfast"" in their commitment to the Canadian fashion industry. It wasn't clear if the fall event would take place. Toronto Fashion Week was once considered North America's second-largest design event but has had a rocky history of late.

377,Amanda Pfeffer,2020-01-19T09:00:00.139Z,Rent hike tension spills over at Carling Avenue highrise,"In a week that revealed many Ottawa renters endured significant rent increases last year, tenants at one Carling Avenue apartment building decided Saturday that enough was enough.   Residents of the highrise at 2880 Carling Ave. owned by Timbercreek Asset Management protested a proposed increase that would see rents jump an average of $50 a month.  ""Where is the justice for tenants?"" asked Mavis Finnamore, an advocate with anti-poverty group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which helped organize the protest.  Tenants tried unsuccessfully to stop Timbercreek's application to increase rents by 5.5 per cent this year by taking their case to the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board, although Timbercreek said it's still waiting for the decision to be formally approved. Since the increase is higher than what's normally allowed, Timbercreek applied for an exemption in order to pay for ""significant capital investment expenses"" like garage repairs and renovations to the common area.  The company argued they needed that higher-than-usual rent hike in order to perform those repairs, something that's allowed under provincial legislation. Finnamore said tenants presented documentation to the board, however, suggesting multiple problems with the building: apartments with no heating, troubles with vermin and mould, and broken appliances and elevators.  ""The landlord tenant board is not protecting tenants,"" said Finnamore. ""These big increases are making life miserable for low-income people. They make people worry about being able to afford housing or whether they could become homeless.""  Many of those who attended Saturday's rally declined to give their names, saying they feared repercussions for speaking out. Bay ward Coun. Theresa Kavanagh told the group that while the province is in charge of rent control, the city can get involved by making sure buildings meet basic standards.  Kavanagh said she's concerned that people are living in poor conditions. ""Probably one of the most spectacular things happened when the bylaw officer came by to check out some of the complaints — and his foot fell through a stair,"" Kavanagh said. ""That happened. I just couldn't believe it.""

The protesters tried to deliver a list of demands to the office of the building's manager, but they were locked out. So for about 15 minutes they chanted slogans in the hallway like ""Fight, fight, fight — housing is a right."" They left after reading a list of demands and posting it near the manager's door. Beyond halting rent increases above the allowable rate, the tenants also want immediate repairs to apartments with outstanding work orders, starting with heating issues, as well as a meeting to address health and safety concerns. Several hours after the protest, tenants began receiving notes under their doors saying Timbercreek would like to meet Jan. 29 to address those issues. ""The open house will give you an opportunity to chat,"" said the note, listing maintenance issues, tenancy matters, and ""future capital improvement projects"" as items for discussion. A Timbercreek spokesperson confirmed to CBC that the letters were sent in response to Saturday's protest. ACORN said it was pleased to see Timbercreek open to speaking with its tenants.   The protest took place the same week the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation released a report showing Ottawa experienced one of its largest year over-year-rent increases, at 8.4 per cent.

378,Kailea Switzer,2020-01-19T13:00:00.987Z,The agony of letting our kids take risks: Opinion,"I am a first-time mother of a one-year-old, and over the past year I've had to temper my fears a million times. From the first night home from the hospital when I held my breath as she slept, to letting her eat grapes, to watching her climb precariously on every piece of furniture we own — it's been a daily practice of managing my own discomfort so that she can live her own risk-filled life.  It can be hard to remember in these moments, but I do truly value risk-taking. As a counsellor and coach, my career is built around helping others take meaningful risks, and in my own life I can easily connect the dots from ""risks I took"" to ""most meaningful experiences I've had.""  Now, as a new parent, I have been reflecting on how I came to appreciate taking meaningful risks. I grew up in Charlottetown, and in this small town where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, my parents weren't afraid to be different. I watched them start new businesses and figure out the challenges as they went. They took on new hobbies and set personal goals. They experimented with recipes, planned unusual vacations, and encouraged us to make our ideas real. Even when my brother wanted to start a wrestling federation in our basement, my dad got out the ropes and mats and helped him build a ring. Their mottos were ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and ""If it were easy, everybody would be doing it."" In that, they modelled meaningful risk-taking and normalized it. When I graduated high school I received a Loran Award, a scholarship and leadership program valued up to $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study in Canada, awarded to only three dozen Canadian graduating students annually. This award has been one of the most enormous privileges of my life. It allowed me to move off-Island to complete my undergraduate degree; without the support of Loran, I never would have moved away. Loran took a risk on me and their choice to do so completely changed the course of my life. That initial move for university was such a stretch for me that I've compared all subsequent risks to it, and something inside me always says, ""Well if you could do that, you can do this."" The more of these stretching experiences I've accumulated, the more enticing new growth opportunities have felt and the more open I've become to seek them out. I believe there is a strong link between taking meaningful risks and how much we trust ourselves. In other words, we take risks if we believe we can handle the outcomes, regardless of what they may be. The Loran foundation trusted me — they believed in my leadership potential and ability to effect positive change in my community, and that helped me trust myself.  This was also the way my parents parented — they always led me to believe that I could handle hard things. Growing up there was no asking if I did my homework, or whether I practiced the piano. My dad is a professional musician and when I wanted to take piano lessons he said, ""OK, but I won't ever push you — it has to be your own choice.""  When I left for university, my parents did not pack up my belongings or shop for my dorm room, they did not oversee my course selection, edit my assignments, or monitor my grades. When I moved to the U.S., there were no questions about my visa, health insurance, or taxes — it was simply assumed that I could and would figure it out. This may seem radical: some might say, ""Well, you were a conscientious kid so your parents could get away with that, but if I didn't remind my kid to do those things, they would just never get done!"" Possibly. But it's also possible that intrinsic motivation and self-accountability can't bloom without space. They trusted me so much that I intuited I was someone to be trusted. That said, I also always felt safe to ask my parents for help. I think their approach made me more transparent with my struggles because I knew they would listen and encourage me, but also that they wouldn't jump in unless I asked them to. Had they tried to solve my problems for me it would have undermined my confidence; it would have implicitly said ""You do not have this."" In learning to trust myself, I felt empowered to gradually stretch my self-imposed limits.  Even though growth can be painful, the feeling of expansion has always made me hungry for more.  As an adult, I intentionally seek out meaningful risks, whether it's sharing something I've created, taking an improv class, asking someone I've just met on a ""friend date,"" or simply trying a new recipe for a dinner party — the discomfort has proven worth it.  But as a child, growth meant my parents had to intentionally let me hurt and struggle. As a new mom, I've never appreciated more what that must have involved. To develop a practice of taking meaningful risks, you also have to be willing to regularly experience vulnerability, discomfort and pain. My baby is only one-year-old, and seeing her struggling is the absolute worst; nonetheless, how am I helping her if she doesn't learn it is safe to do so? I know the qualities I value most in people — empathy, compassion, depth, insight and the ability to see things from a nuanced perspective — are born from painful experiences. Reframing my daughter's pain as ""stretching for her emotional expansion"" and her struggles as ""grit-building opportunities"" won't help very much when those moments come up, but perhaps it will help me see where her struggle ends and my tolerance of her discomfort begins. I work with many university students. I love this age group because their experience with taking meaningful risks has often been limited, and watching them take the reigns of their own lives is exciting. We examine their relationship with trying and their willingness to allow others to see them in the process of learning. For those who were high achievers in high school, this can be especially challenging. Asking questions in class, going to office hours, getting help from the writing resource centre, hiring a tutor or simply getting feedback on an assignment can be extremely difficult for students as they feel they ""aren't the kind of student who does those things.""  I try to increase their comfort with not knowing, gradually help them equate the feeling of struggle with growth, and ideally stretch their capacity for meaningful risk-taking in ways that will continue throughout their lives.  When I work with adults, often the barriers to meaningful risk-taking are increasingly dense. People will tell me they are struggling to find meaning in their life, or say that they feel stuck or bored. I'll respond by asking, ""How often do you really put yourself out there?"" and ""When was the last time you genuinely acted vulnerably?"" All meaningful risks require us to be vulnerable with ourselves and others, and most significantly they require us to be willing to change what we believe about ourselves.  If you had told me when I graduated high school what my next 10 years would look like — that I would attend Harvard University, move to Los Angeles, and leave my stable and rewarding career to start a business — I would never have believed you.  So when people ask ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" I say ""I can't wait to find out!"" because I have grown to love and appreciate that feeling of unknown possibility. The emotional exposure I feel when taking a meaningful risk is also what makes me feel alive and most ""in"" my own life. The practice of meaningful risk-taking has taught me that I'm always only one experience away from a new understanding of myself and the world. It has allowed me to expand and broaden my self-definition. So how can I use my experiences and the lessons I've learned to now help my daughter pursue meaningful risks?  I need to model risk-taking and show that while no true risk lacks vulnerability, the emotional exposure is worth it. I also need to show her that asking for help requires strength, so she will know it is safe to do so.  I need to get out of her way and give her space to struggle. My hope is that in doing so, she will prove to herself that she can handle hard things and she will come to deeply trust herself.  Lastly, through her own ongoing practice of meaningful risk-taking, I hope she will delight in the fact that the story of who she will become is always being written.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

379,Reid Southwick,2020-01-19T09:00:00.956Z,Major Canadian pot companies facing proposed class-action lawsuits in the U.S.,"Some of Canada's biggest cannabis producers are facing proposed class-action lawsuits in the United States after investors were hit with steep financial losses in the stock market. At least nine U.S. law firms are pursuing cases against Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis and Hexo Corp. in American courts. Although the allegations vary, each pot producer is accused of misleading investors or failing to disclose certain problems with their businesses. When those problems became publicly known, the lawsuits claim, share prices plunged and investors were stuck with losses. ""[Investors] are mad; they were taken by surprise,"" said Reed Kathrein, a lawyer at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, which is pursuing claims against all three producers. None of the allegations have been proven in court. Each of the companies declined to be interviewed for this story. Canopy and Aurora denied the allegations in brief statements, while Hexo said only its lawyers are reviewing the claims. These companies were among several Canadian cannabis firms that listed on U.S. stock exchanges, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm surrounding the industry before and after Canada legalized pot. ""But when they hit obstacles, the share prices declined,"" said Kevin LaCroix, a Cleveland-based lawyer who is not involved in any of the proposed class actions, but has followed the industry. ""It's pretty common in the United States, when a company experiences a significant decline in its share price, opportunistic plaintiff lawyers will try and seize on that as an opportunity to try and make some money."" Even if the lawsuits aren't successful, they could still pose challenges to companies that are trying to win over investors, said Brad Poulos, a lecturer at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management. ""Anytime there's uncertainty about the future of a company, that's going to create uncertainty in the minds of shareholders,"" Poulos said. ""As the market determines the likelihood of a suit being successful, that will start to get priced into the stock,"" he said. The cases against these three companies have attracted the attention of at least nine legal firms because of a feature of U.S. law, Kathrein said. After an investor's lawyer files an initial securities lawsuit, they publish a notice, which gives other investors 60 days to apply to the court to become lead plaintiff in the case. Law firms then issue press releases seeking investors in the hopes that they can attract a client who becomes the lead plaintiff. One of the qualifications to become lead plaintiff is they suffered the greatest amount of alleged losses. ""It's a beauty contest,"" Kathrein said. ""These press releases are basically saying, 'Hey, I'm part of the beauty contest; select me.'"" Hexo, based in Gatineau, Que., is accused of failing to tell investors that it was inflating its revenue figures through a process called channel-stuffing, which involves sending retailers more products than they are able to sell. A court filing alleges Hexo didn't tell investors its reported cannabis inventory was misstated and that it was growing pot in an Ontario facility not properly licensed by Health Canada. A class-action complaint filed with a New York court says when Hexo announced in March 2019 it was buying rival Newstrike Brands, the company said it was acquiring Newstrike's four production facilities. It also said it was ""committing to achieving over $400 million in net revenue in 2020."" But by October, the company withdrew that commitment after projecting its net revenue for 2019 would hit between $46.5 million and $48.5 million. It blamed a slow rollout of retail stores across Canada, a delay in government approvals for edibles and vapes and early signs of falling prices. Two weeks later, Hexo announced 200 layoffs. In November, the company revealed one of the facilities it acquired from Newstrike was growing cannabis without the proper federal approvals. A press release said the firm learned about the problem in July, shut down production and notified Health Canada. ""All told, Hexo has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization as a result of these disclosures,"" the complaint says. ""As a result of defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the company's securities, plaintiff and other class members have suffered significant losses and damages."" According to the filing, anyone who bought Hexo shares on U.S. stock exchanges between Jan. 25 and Nov. 15, 2019 can join the proposed class action. During that period, Hexo's shares plunged by 65 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange. In a brief email to CBC News, Hexo said it does not comment on litigation issues, but that its legal team is actively handling the matter. LaCroix, the Cleveland lawyer not involved in any of these claims, says law firms pursuing the cannabis class actions have to meet a high bar. It's not enough to argue that investors lost money. Their lawyers have to prove the defendant companies and executives intended to mislead shareholders when they made the allegedly false or misleading statements, a concept called scienter, he said. ""Scienter is meant to encompass not only actual intent to deceive but reckless indifference or just total indifference to whether or not investors are misled,"" LaCroix said. ""That's often where shareholder claimants fall short, is they don't sufficiently plead scienter."" Kathrein, one of the lawyers pursuing the class actions, said he wouldn't be involved in the cases unless he was convinced he could meet the scienter test. ""We don't just rely on public facts,"" he said. ""We have investigators that get out there and try and find witnesses who can tie the information that was allegedly known to them, tie that information to the senior executives."" Edmonton-based Aurora Cannabis is facing claims the company exaggerated or over-estimated the demand for its pot and produced too much, leading to oversupply. In November, Aurora said it was halting or deferring construction at production facilities in Denmark and Medicine Hat, Alta. It also reported disappointing financial results, including a 24 per cent drop in quarterly net revenues. A couple of months later, the company told media it was selling a greenhouse in Exeter, Ont. Another allegation is that Aurora was not up front with investors that it didn't secure necessary approvals from German authorities to use a certain growing method in that country. After a Marijuana Business Daily report revealed German pharmacists were ordered to stop selling Aurora's medical pot until there was a review, the lawsuit says, the company's share price dropped. ""As a result of defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the company's securities, plaintiffs and other class members have suffered significant losses and damages,"" states the complaint, filed a week ago in a New York court. The filing says anyone who bought Aurora shares on U.S. stock exchanges between Oct. 23, 2018 and Jan 6, 2020 can join the proposed class action. During that period, Aurora's shares plunged by 75 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange, from $7.51 per share to $1.90. Aurora denies the allegations. ""The company believes it has conducted itself in accordance with all relevant securities laws, and refutes these claims,"" it said in a brief statement. ""The company intends to pursue a full defence against these suits."" Canopy Growth, Canada's largest pot producer, is facing allegations it exaggerated or overestimated the potential market for its products in Canadian retail stores, leading to inventory writeoffs and restructuring charges.  One class-action complaint says the Smiths Falls, Ont.-based company issued press releases leading up to legalization that it was expanding its production capacity to meet projections of growing demand for cannabis in Canada and around the world.  ""As a result of the dissemination of the aforementioned false and misleading reports, releases and public statements, the market price of Canopy securities was artificially inflated,"" the complaint states. In November 2019, the company reported lower-than-expected revenues and a $374.6-million loss.  Then-CEO Mark Zekulin told analysts at the time the disappointing results were the result in part of a slow rollout of retail stores in Ontario, which cut its potential Canadian market in half. He said some provinces had slowed their purchases of cannabis because of high inventories, though Canopy's shipments were up in its most recent quarter. Canopy's stock fell on the news. Between Sept. 8, 2017 and Nov. 13, 2019 — the period that the proposed class action covers — Canopy's share price on the New York exchange fell by more than a third, from $28.26 per share to $18.50. When asked for comment on the allegations, Canopy referred to a November 2019 press release, in which the company said it believes it has acted ""in accordance with all relevant securities laws, and that the claims are without merit. ""The company intends to vigorously defend itself against any such suits."" Kathrein, whose law firm is seeking the class actions, said the cases will start to move ahead after deadlines to select lead plaintiffs elapse, starting Monday. Ultimately, he believes the cases will likely be collapsed into one proposed class action for each of the three companies.  The defendant companies will likely file motions to dismiss the cases against them, Kathrein said. It could take months to debate those motions, which means they may not be resolved until the end of the year, if not later, he said. If the lawsuits survive that stage, it could take years to reach a resolution through the courts, though both sides could negotiate a settlement.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/major-canadian-pot-companies-facing-proposed-class-action-lawsuits-in-the-u-s-1.5431520,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hexo-s-poor-outlook-could-foreshadow-bad-trip-for-cannabis-industry-1.5318470 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hexo-shares-tumble-1.5409246 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hexo-reports-56-million-fourth-quarter-loss-1.5339629 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/aurora-cannabis-cannabis-construction-1.5360640 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canopy-growth-delay-cannabis-drinks-1.5430755 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canopy-growth-quarter-loss-1.5359058,/news/business/canopy-growth-delay-cannabis-drinks-1.5430755 /news/business/hexo-shares-tumble-1.5409246 /news/canada/ottawa/hexo-s-poor-outlook-could-foreshadow-bad-trip-for-cannabis-industry-1.5318470

381,Connell Smith,2020-01-17T21:45:07.552Z,First look at apartment complex replacing Saint John's Gothic Arches,"People living near Saint John's Gothic Arches now have some idea of the proposed apartment building that could soon replace the nearly 140-year-old former church.  The plan by Tower Contracting would see a seven-storey building, 11 metres higher than the 14-metre maximum height set out in city planning rules for the neighbourhood at Wentworth and Leinster streets.  The height variance is one of a number of issues related to the development that will be considered by the city's planning advisory board at its Tuesday meeting. Neighbour John Neville of Orange Street was surprised to find an architect's rendering of the building in a letter from the city that arrived in his mailbox Thursday. ""I expected something that would be more in keeping with the architecture and the building heights in the area of Princess and Wentworth,"" said Neville. ""I don't think that would be a good idea for this neighbourhood. We've got some of the most interesting architecture in Eastern Canada here. To put in something that looks like a 1950s schoolhouse with the brick and square, rectangular glass windows, is not in keeping with the 1880s architecture here."" Neville said he's not part of a community group, and not against development or high-density housing but feels the building should be restricted to a maximum of four storeys. Patrick McCaffrey's Leinster Street home is even closer to the proposed site. He has no problem with the height plan. He said the Gothic Arches, a very large building that could seat 1,400 people,  towered over the same area for more than a century. ""That wouldn't bother me a bit,"" he said. ""That skyline has always been full with a building."" A height map on the city website lays out guidelines for building heights in different areas of the central peninsula. The Wentworth Street neighbourhood is clearly set within an area with ""maximum building height"" of 14 metres. The issue of building height restrictions was discussed at a recent council meeting, where staff were quick to point out the the maximum height rule is ""a starting point."" ""The height map itself will evolve over time,"" said Kenneth Melanson, community planning manager for the municipality. Rental units in Saint John's central peninsula are in demand. The most recent CMHC survey, for October, shows a 2.7 per cent vacancy rate for one-bedroom apartments. For two-bedroom units, the rate is 0.6 per cent.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/developer-apartment-complex-gothic-arches-1.5431287,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/centenary-queen-square-demolition-1.5395480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/centenary-queen-square-church-sold-wilbur-1.5341803,/news/canada/new-brunswick/centenary-queen-square-demolition-1.5395480 /news/canada/new-brunswick/centenary-queen-square-church-sold-wilbur-1.5341803

Smudging typically involves burning sweetgrass, sage or other materials. It's a common spiritual practice for many First Nations and Métis people. Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations Vice-Chief Heather Bear said smudging ""is a vital part of our culture"" and hopes access to the practice is not affected. She said it helps Indigenous inmates with their rehabilitation. Smudging also keeps them calm and decreases stress, she said, which makes the jail safer for everyone. ""It's paramount to have access to that healing."" In an email to CBC News, the ministry official said previous complaints at Regina and Prince Albert jails led to a restriction on areas where smudging is permitted. The official said no matter the conclusion of the review, smudging will still be available to Saskatoon inmates in some form. The official said the government is committed to providing these and other cultural services to First Nations and Metis inmates.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-correctional-centre-smudging-1.5431262,[],/news/canada/nova-scotia/trevor-sanipass-aknute-n-mi-kmaq-culture-column-language-smudging-ceremony-1.5399852 /news/canada/saskatchewan/smudge-walk-regina-1.5195033
383,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-20T19:53:24.984Z,"'We want the respect we deserve,' Pallister says of Manitoba's new climate change plan","Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister emerged from a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday, saying he's prepared to present a modified climate change plan that could include a carbon tax, but he wants the federal government to respect and recognize his province's record on environmental protection. ""We deserve to be respected for our green record. We do not deserve to be called climate change deniers by anybody,"" he said. ""Political science is fine before an election. Now let's talk environmental science. We're prepared to be measured on our green plan, and we want acceptance of our made-in-Manitoba green strategies. We want the respect we deserve as a province."" Pallister said he will continue to have a dialogue with the federal government about Manitoba's strategy, and that he is prepared to modify the provincial plan that could include a carbon price ""of some kind.""  He declined to provide details, but said he prefers it would be ""flat and low like the prairie horizon."" Deputy Prime Minister and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said while Manitoba and the federal government might not share the same perspective on the right approach to tackling climate change, there is much respect for the province. ""When it comes to the question of respect, the premier already has tremendous respect from me, tremendous respect from the prime minister,"" she said. ""I hope that he would agree that we have a very effective, friendly working relationship with him, and we really appreciate it."" When it comes to climate change, Freeland said the government was open to hearing Pallister make the case for his approach, and to understand the rationale behind it. There will be ongoing conversations with the province on the issue, she said. Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson pointed out that New Brunswick put a price on pollution that met the federal benchmark and was therefore permitted to implement its own price. ""The same thing would hold true here in Manitoba if in fact the government determined that they wanted to implement a Manitoba-based price on pollution that met the federal benchmark,"" he said during a funding announcement event in Winnipeg. ""They are certainly free to do that in the same way that British Columbia does it, in the same way that many other provinces do it."" The Liberal cabinet retreat began its second day in Winnipeg Monday with the meeting between Trudeau and Pallister to talk about public safety, flood protection and the thorny topic of the federal carbon tax. The location of the retreat in the Manitoba capital, considered the gateway to the West, is considered strategic for a government working to ease tensions with the West.  Various ministers, including Freeland, have been making outreach efforts to build bridges with western provinces. ""The outreach is good, it's noble, and I think the intention is real,"" Pallister said. ""But you'll measure the effectiveness, as you should, by results. By achievements."" Freeland said she has travelled to seven provinces so far, and plans to visit the others plus the territories soon. Her takeaway is that Canadians love Canada and have a great commitment to pulling together to keep Canada united at a time of global instability. The Liberals were shut out of Saskatchewan and Alberta in the Oct. 21 federal election, largely due to voter dissatisfaction there over the carbon tax and the lack of progress over a pipeline being built. Trudeau has since promised to listen, reach out and address those concerns to calm the rising sentiment of western alienation. Yet the competing objectives of making climate change action a priority, while promoting a pipeline is proving to be a challenge. After delivering a briefing to cabinet Sunday, Ian Anderson, chief executive of Trans Mountain Corp., was asked by reporters how Canadians might feel about the government's apparently contradictory objectives. Anderson replied that while there must be action on climate change, measures are also needed to promote economic development and trade. ""The oil that we're going to move in this pipeline is going to be consumed,"" Anderson said. ""It's going to come from somewhere. Why not from Canada?  ""Why not from a country that has the highest standards of regulation, the highest standards of responsible development in the world?"" Anderson said the Trans Mountain pipeline project is under construction in Alberta and British Columbia, employing roughly 2,700 people. About 10 per cent of those employees are Indigenous, and there is also contract work underway with other Indigenous companies, he said.  ""We hope that will be a real success story of the project once we're completed,"" he said, adding that the scheduled completion date is in 2022. Trudeau also met with Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman today, and the pair discussed infrastructure and public safety, including anti-drug strategies. Inside the cabinet room, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair is scheduled to update ministers Monday on the government's plans to bring in gun control measures. The Liberals have promised to allow municipalities to ban handguns, and to prohibit certain types of military-style assault weapons. Last month, Blair said a list of those prohibited weapons would be released ""as quickly as possible.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-pallister-liberal-cabinet-meeting-1.5432616,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-trudeau-carbon-tax-1.5428312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/prime-minister-trudeau-winnipeg-bowman-pallister-meeting-1.5431597 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244,/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-trudeau-carbon-tax-1.5428312 /news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244 /news/canada/manitoba/prime-minister-trudeau-winnipeg-bowman-pallister-meeting-1.5431597
384,Bryan Eneas,2020-01-18T22:19:09.013Z,Regina man warns of possible AutoTRADER.ca scam,"A Regina man is warning others about possible scammers operating on AutoTRADER.ca.  Peter Adebara found an ad for a 2009 Honda Pilot on AutoTRADER.ca, which had a ""ridiculous"" price tag of $3,900. Adebara reached out to the seller to get more information. The seller told him they were no longer living in Canada and sent Adebara photos of the vehicle in question.  ""The first thing that flagged my curiosity was the colour of the vehicle that was posted was blue, but the pictures sent to me, [the vehicle] was green,"" Adebara told CBC news.  ""The second thing was the ad itself was pulled almost immediately.""  Adebara said he ""decided to play along"" with the seller's games and he was told someone in Regina had all the vehicle's documentation and that person would deliver the vehicle and take Adebara's payment.  Adebara was then contacted by the person who was supposed to meet him with the vehicle and told cash wouldn't work; the deal would need to be done through a Western Union wire transfer to the seller, who was allegedly located in Bolivia. ""It's a secure and reliable transfer service. It's secure with a secret code that'll be given to u (sic) once u (sic) make the transfer and no one can get your money from western union without the code,"" read emails Adebara shared with CBC News. ""You will need to go the nearest western union store or money mart with the amount of the $3900 cash to get the transfer ready and when the car comes and everything checks out u (sic) will hand over the transfer receipt and the transfer secret code to me as form of payment and take possession of the car."" Adebara decided to do some internet research on the people who he'd been in contact with but couldn't find anything tied to either individual that satisfied his outstanding questions about who he was dealing with.  He decided to go through with meeting the person who was supposed to deliver the vehicle — without the requested Western Union transfer — but they never showed up at the agreed time or location.  After that experience, Adebara said he found two more ads on Autotrader.ca, listed in Regina, that also raised his suspicions.  He said the posters operated in a similar manner in saying they were out of province and someone else would meet him with the vehicle. ""That's why I wanted to reach out and say, 'You know what? There's a scam out there and if these people are not careful they'll be scammed out of their money,'"" Adebara said. Adebara said he flagged the ads he was suspicious of to AutoTRADER.ca.  In an email, AutoTRADER.ca said the allegedly fraudulent listing on its website was flagged and removed within 24 hours.  When contacted, AutoTRADER.ca noted the interactions with Adebara and the alleged fraudsters happened off-platform.  ""Contact the customer directly by the phone number listed on our site. If it does not work, do not go about solely through email. Most cases of fraud are email based,"" a prepared statement from Autotrader.ca said.  The website includes a number of tips to spot a possibly fraudulent seller.  Characteristics — like interacting with someone claiming to be located out of country — in the posts Adebara described to CBC News, were listed in the tips as possible fraudulent postings. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-man-warns-autotrader-scam-1.5432275,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-man-selling-vehicles-online-rolled-back-odometers-say-police-1.2782770 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/safety-tips-for-wild-west-of-online-sales-1.1330720,/news/canada/windsor/lasalle-mans-car-stolen-during-test-drive-1.4742235 /news/business/used-car-shopping-1.4482684
385,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-28T16:10:35.194Z,"'Companies knew they had a big problem': Kia, Hyundai owners say they were knowingly sold defective vehicles ","A group of vehicle owners is going after two major automakers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, claiming they were knowingly sold defective vehicles then left to pay for losses and repairs when the engines failed or caught fire.  In a lawsuit filed this week, Hyundai and Kia are accused of intentionally concealing the defect from buyers of vehicles with Theta, Nu, and Gamma engines. ""When complaints came ... [owners] were told 'gosh we haven't heard of that happening. Isn't that weird?' And in fact the companies knew they had a big problem,"" Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who is heading up the lawsuit, told Go Public. The class action was filed in Court of Queen's Bench in Regina on Monday, but has yet to be certified by the court. It names Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and their American counterparts — Hyundai Motors America and Kia Motors America. None of the allegations in the lawsuit have been proven in court. A Go Public investigation revealed concerns about Hyundai and Kia engines failing at high speeds or spontaneously bursting into flames — putting some drivers and their passengers into life-threatening situations and leaving others with thousands in repair bills. Consumer and safety advocates have criticized the South Korean automakers for taking too long to issue recalls of too few models with the Theta-family engines. The recalls started in 2015 and are still rolling out. ""Their difficulty is that they can't fix the problem. They don't know what to do about the problem. So a recall where there's no fix is really no recall at all,"" Merchant said. Go Public asked Hyundai if it had a fix for the engine problems, but it didn't respond to that question directly. Merchant says the proposed class-action suit involves 37 Hyundai and Kia owners, and seven different models ranging in years from 2011-16 — but he expects the number of drivers and vehicles involved to grow once word gets out about the lawsuit.  The legal action is also looking for compensation for owners with the problematic engines who haven't had failures or fires, but are facing a loss in vehicle value. ""For the vast majority of people, they're not going to have a safety problem. And many of them are going to be compelled to continue to operate these vehicles because they can't afford the hit of getting rid of them. So they're entitled to financial compensation that flows from having a vehicle that's significantly depreciated,"" Merchant says. Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and Kia Motors America all told Go Public they do not comment on any current or pending litigation. Hyundai Motors USA responded to Go Public's questions about the latest Canadian lawsuit with a general statement.  ""Nothing is more important than the safety and security of Hyundai customers,"" spokesperson Michael Stewart wrote in an email. ""Hyundai actively monitors and evaluates potential safety concerns, including non-collision engine fires, with all of our vehicles and acts swiftly to recall any vehicles with safety-related defects … Hyundai quality and safety is among the best in the industry.""  Go Public continues to get complaints from Hyundai and Kia owners, who say they are interested in joining a class-action suit if it means the automakers would have to take responsibility. Marnie and Adam Nelson contacted Go Public after seeing previous engine stories. The couple's 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe caught fire while it was parked in their driveway last March. They bought it six months earlier and paid more than $50,000 for the SUV. They contacted Hyundai's head office by email to report the fire and ask for a refund on the extended warranties they had purchased, but say no one followed up to investigate. Instead, the couple says most of their messages to head office were ignored and the local dealership was only interested in getting them to buy a new vehicle. ""As soon as they [the dealership] found out we weren't going to come back in and buy another car, we were persona non grata, they wanted nothing to do with us. No return calls — nothing,"" Adam said. ""They should be standing behind their products better,"" Marnie told Go Public.  The dealership declined to respond to Go Public's questions about the couple's situation directly, referring us to head office.  Hyundai says its records show the Nelsons went directly to their insurance company to report the fire and only reached out to the company for a refund on an extended warranty they had purchased for the vehicle. The couple says they received a partial refund. The company wrote in an email to Go Public that its policy is to investigate every case of a fire, ""that we are aware of and requested to investigate to determine if the cause is attributed to neglect, abuse, environment or the product itself."" The Nelsons say their fire was never investigated by the company. The company did reach out to the couple after Go Public inquiries.  The engine in Daniel Roukema's 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe didn't burn — it died in 2016 while he was driving on a highway near Toronto. He says he had to pay about $9,000 to replace it. When he asked the company to cover the cost, Roukema says it refused and blamed his lack of upkeep for the engine failure, which he denies.  Two recalls were issued for the vehicle after he paid to replace his engine. ""I think the way they've handled the situation is absolutely abhorrent … we [owners] ought to be compensated,"" he said. Hyundai did not respond to specific questions about Roukema's case, but said ""if a customer previously paid for repairs in advance of a recall being issued, and it is determined that the repairs required were a result of a recall, Hyundai will reimburse the customer for the recall-specific repairs to their vehicle."" Hyundai says it will soon launch what it calls a microsite that aims to answer questions for customers affected by recalls. In Quebec, the Automobile Protection Association and a group of Kia owners are suing Kia for compensation for alleged engine problems with the 2010-15 Kia Forte. Fires are not part of that class-action lawsuit. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September. The transportation authority is asking owners who have had problems to contact the department.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

386,Spencer Van Dyk,2020-01-19T10:00:00.676Z,Quebec agriculture minister concerned as American officials push for ban on Canadian seafood imports,"Some American senators and members of Congress claim Canadian shipping and fishing activities are harming endangered North American right whales, and they're calling on the White House to place an embargo on Canadian seafood. In a December letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, four elected officials in Maine blamed Canadian fisheries, specifically snow crab gear, for 14 right whale deaths, eight of which were in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, along with members of Congress Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, asked the U.S. government to stop importing fish products ""caught with technology that kills or injures ocean mammals."" ""The number of serious injuries and mortalities directly tied to Canadian shipping and fisheries activities, however, continues to mount.,"" they wrote. In an email to CBC News, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food spokesperson Laurence Voyzelle said fisheries are a vital industry to several regions of Quebec. She said about 75 per cent of Quebec's fish and seafood is exported to the United States. Voyzelle said Quebec Agriculture Minister André Lamontagne is very concerned by the embargo request. ""Minister Lamontagne considers such a possibility to be unacceptable and is calling on the federal government to do everything to avoid [an embargo],"" she wrote. Voyzelle said marine mammal mortalities — specifically North Atlantic right whale deaths — are a major concern for the provincial government. There are about 400 animals left, and less than 100 adult females.   Lyne Morissette — a marine biologist based in Rimouski who specializes in sea mammals and fisheries interactions — called the letter a blatant political move ahead of this year's U.S. elections.  ""This is basically a political game to gain attention on the East Coast of the U.S. trying to benefit the lobster fishermen in Maine,"" she said. Morissette said the letter attempts to blame Canadian fisheries for whale deaths, when scientists and fishermen on both sides of the border work closely together to improve protection efforts. She said the letter spreads misinformation about Canada's work to protect right whales, which she called a relatively new challenge because the Gulf of St. Lawrence is new territory for the mammals. ""It's just highlighting false information and not highlighting everything we're doing [to protect whales],"" she said. Despite the letter, Morisette is hopeful for the future of North Atlantic right whales, because she sees scientists working with the industry to find solutions. ""It would be terrible because most snow crab exports go to the U.S., so it would be really bad for the fisheries and the economy of Eastern Canada,"" Morissette said. ""But again, it's more of a political game right now."" ""Time spent finding a culprit and blaming one another is time that we could spend on working together to figure out solutions,"" she said. A representative for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in an email to the CBC that the agency is reviewing the letter.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/crab-embargo-letter-1.5432316,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/right-whales-2020-1.5406684 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canada-mandatory-gear-marking-2020-fishing-industry-1.5422962 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/right-whale-deaths-canada-u-s-snow-crab-import-ban-1.5287522,/news/canada/montreal/right-whales-2020-1.5406684 /news/canada/nova-scotia/canada-mandatory-gear-marking-2020-fishing-industry-1.5422962 /news/canada/nova-scotia/right-whale-deaths-canada-u-s-snow-crab-import-ban-1.5287522 https://www.collins.senate.gov/sites/default/files/Signed-%20Maine%20Delegation%20letter%20re%20Canada.pdf
387,Pierre Saint-Arnaud,2020-01-21T02:28:51.269Z,'Mother never stops dying': Duceppe family pushes forward with suit against senior home,"On the anniversary of their mother's death, former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe and his family announced they will proceed with a lawsuit against the luxury seniors' residence where the 93-year-old woman perished after being trapped in an outdoor courtyard after a false fire alarm. Hélène Rowley Hotte died of hypothermia on Jan. 20, 2019, on a morning when it was a bitter -35 C outside and snowing. In legal documents filed Monday, Rowley Hotte Duceppe's seven children allege their mother's life would have been saved if not for the ""gross negligence'' of the residence. ""Mother never stops dying. It continues all the time because (the residence's responsibility) isn't recognized,'' Gilles Duceppe said in a brief interview following the announcement of the lawsuit. Lawyer Marc-Antoine Cloutier told the Montreal news conference that while the death may have been accidental, the alleged negligence of staff at the Lux Gouverneur Montreal contributed to the tragedy. ""When we don't put in place what needs to be put in place, there are foreseeable consequences,'' he said. A coroner's report released last summer said video surveillance showed the woman trapped in the courtyard for six hours. She tried to get back inside the building to no avail, since her access card wouldn't let her back inside, and no one noticed her absence. Cloutier said the family and the estate are seeking $1.25 million for both the suffering experienced by Rowley Hotte Duceppe and the pain her death has caused her seven children. Gilles Duceppe said his mother had a ""horrible fear of fire'' and left her apartment upon hearing an alarm. He said the residence should have checked security cameras and the building's exits after the all-clear was given and the alarm turned out to be false. ""We can't understand how something like this can happen,'' he said. ""There were cameras. They could have seen her.'' ​​​​ Duceppe says he also doesn't understand how staff allegedly didn't look to see if anyone was outside after the alarm on the emergency door into the courtyard signalled it had been opened. ""You have to open the door: they could have saved her, she would have come in. She was just there, on the other side.'' His sister, Monique Duceppe, said the family chose the residence precisely because it was advertised as safe. ""That's why we went there, because in their brochure, it was the highest technology in terms of security,'' she said. Her mother was happy there, she said. ""Nobody thinks they'll end their days like that, outside...'' she said, her voice trailing off. Cloutier said that while the family is only suing the one residence, he hopes the case prompts a wider societal discussion on the safety of seniors' homes, and the need for stricter standards. ""We hear more and more about the problems that stem from the lack of security in these residences, but also sometimes because of lack of personnel, lack of training, carelessness in some cases.'' The family sent the Lux Gouverneur notice last July that they were seeking damages and were prepared to take legal action if the residence did not respond. Cloutier said the possibility of criminal charges was raised at first, but the family ultimately decided on a civil action. The management of the residence said in a statement Monday saying staff remain ""extremely shaken by the death of Mrs. Rowley-Hotte.'' ""The safety and well-being of residents is a top priority for management. Due to the ongoing legal procedures, we will not be granting interviews,'' the statement reads.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/duceppe-sues-montreal-1.5434146,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/woman-found-seniors-residence-montreal-east-1.5118117 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-woman-dies-93-senior-residence-1.5198082,/news/canada/montreal/gilles-duceppe-mother-death-damages-1.5207125 /news/canada/montreal/gilles-duceppe-mother-hypothermia-helene-rowley-hotte-1.4986538 /news/canada/montreal/coroners-report-gilles-duceppe-mother-death-1.5179581
388,"Tyana Grundig, Jeannie Stiglic, Makda Ghebresslassie",2019-11-22T09:00:00.413Z,Hidden camera investigation reveals 'scary' and 'misleading' sales pitches to sell blue light lenses ,"It's no secret that we're spending more time in front of screens than ever before. Canadians say they spend almost 11 hours a day in front of them — at their desks, on their laptops and especially on their smartphones. But after a long day at work, our eyes often start to feel dry, tired and strained, and many people are desperate for a solution.  Enter blue light filtering lenses. Optical chains say they protect our eyes from blue light emitted from digital screens, and consumers are buying in.  And it turns out it's not just eye strain they want to warn us about. A hidden camera investigation by CBC's Marketplace found sales associates at some of Canada's largest optical chains making ""misleading"" health claims about blue light from digital screens, but experts say there is no scientific evidence that blue light from computer monitors and screens is harmful. Staff at four leading chains cautioned buyers that digital screens could damage their retinas and could lead to serious eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts. Two opticians at Hudson's Bay Optical suggested a link to cancer based on an in-store pamphlet provided by lens manufacturer VisionEase, while Vogue Optical's website suggests blue light may increase the risk of ""certain types of cancers."" Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery later told Marketplace the pamphlet is ""incorrect"" and will be pulled from Hudson's Bay Optical stores.  But experts in the fields of optometry and ophthalmology say there's no evidence that blue light from digital screens is harmful.  Dr. Rahul Khurana, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the idea of blue-light blocking is ""flawed on so many levels."" ""Blue light fear, paranoia, is really out there,"" said Khurana. ""But there's no evidence to show it's truly dangerous and blocking it has not ever [been] shown to [have] any benefits."" Marketplace producers went undercover and visited multiple Hakim Optical, Vogue Optical, Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery and LensCrafters locations in southern Ontario to see how the companies market the lenses to consumers.  Several dispensing opticians and salespeople told the producers that blue light from digital screens can lead to fatigue and headaches. One optician said blue light has ""very sharp rays, penetrating at the back of the eyes,"" while another salesperson said ""it tears the eyes right out of you."" Watch Marketplace go undercover at optional retailers: But more ""serious"" and even ""scary-sounding"" to ophthalmologist and macular specialist Dr. Sunir Garg were claims that blue light from digital devices might lead to retinal damage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and possibly cancer.  Buying blue light filtering lenses, it was suggested, might eliminate these risks. ""They're introducing this technology that blocks [the digital blue light] out,"" said one student optician. ""So we are not going to be seeing things like cataracts or macular degeneration, damage to your retina, things like that.""  Many of these claims are also found on Vogue Optical, Hakim, and LensCrafters websites and promotional material. Marketplace asked Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, to review the hidden camera footage.  He was concerned about how salespeople and opticians were ""misleading"" customers with claims about how the light from screens can damage eyes. Retinal damage and macular degeneration are ""serious"" claims, Garg said, ""but the blue lights from your screen is not the cause of that stuff.""  ""I think a lot of this is just to create fear and confusion and when people have fear and are confused, they end up spending money on things they don't need to spend money on,"" said Garg.  Garg's research has led him to conclude that far from benefiting customers, these lenses are mostly benefiting the companies that are selling them. ""Maybe those [blue light filtering lenses] are decisions made in different boardrooms across the country and around the world,"" Garg said, ""but from a science perspective, I don't think people need to worry about this at all.""  He doesn't blame the staff at these chains for spreading these claims, however.  ""I can't fault them [because] I'm sure they're getting a little info sheet that says here's three talking points about blue light-blocking lenses, but it's not based on scientific data,"" Garg said.  ""People will quote that blue light can hurt retinal cells,"" Garg said, ""but what they're not telling you is that it's not been shown in any group of people who are using their screens.""  The science into the harms from blue light is mostly done with retinal cells in a petri dish, he said, ""or taking a poor mouse and and shining a blue light ray intensely into their eyeball for hours on end."" Both Khurana and Garg told Marketplace there's no research that suggests blue light filtering lenses are necessary.  Phillip Yuhas, an assistant professor of optometry at Ohio State University, agrees. He said studies have shown people blink far less during computer use and that blue light filters have not shown any improved ""visual comfort"" for digital eye strain.  Khurana said if the problem people are having is from digital eyestrain, then blue light filters are doing nothing to address the core issue and ""could be doing more harm than good.""  But that hasn't stopped eyeglass retailers from promoting them. One optician told Marketplace  the blue filter lens is like an ""extra shield on top of your eyes to protect your eyes from harmful rays.""  The lenses can be purchased with or without a prescription and range in price from $20 to more than $100.     Global sales of the lenses reached $18 million US in 2019, according to Marketwatch.com, and are projected to exceed $27 million US by 2024.    Staring at screens for a long time can make eyes feel dry, tired and strained, but blue light is not the culprit, said Garg, and purchasing special lenses won't fix the issue. ""What's bothering [people] isn't the blue light. It's the fact that when they're staring at their screen a lot they're not blinking as often. ""That causes the eye to dry out, [and] when your eyes become dry, they become irritated and scratchy and tired.""  To deal with that, he recommends a simple fix. It's called  ""the 20-20-20 rule.""  Look at least 20 feet (six metres) away from your screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.  Blue light does wake us up and make us more alert, so too much late at night can make it hard to get to sleep. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends turning off devices or turning on blue light filters, a couple of hours before going to bed.  In the United Kingdom, claims like the ones heard in Canada by Marketplace producers aren't allowed. Opticians and eyeglass retailers risk being fined if they make unproven claims about blue light from digital devices. In 2015, Boots Opticians were reprimanded and fined 400,000 pounds for making ""misleading"" claims that blue light causes retinal damage.   Dr. John O'Hagan, an optical radiation expert who works for Public Health England's (PHE) centre for radiation, chemical and environmental hazards, conducted a study on blue light from digital devices on behalf of the organization.  He analyzed the amount of blue light coming from various sources including the sky, lightbulbs, mobile phones and computer screens.  ""Blue light in our normal environment is not dangerous at all,"" O'Hagan told Marketplace ""The main source of blue light for us is from the sky and a nice sunny day."" The PHE study found that for smartphones, laptops and digital devices, the amount of blue light emitted was less than one per cent of the safe exposure level, even if stared at all day.  O'Hagan said that the light levels from a smartphone, tablet or laptop are ""considerably below the levels that we experience outside, even in winter."" We get about 30 times more blue light just by being outside, he said.  ""You could stare at your phone all day long, right above the face, and the amount of blue light is not significant,"" O'Hagan said.  ""There is no evidence that blue light from your mobile or other devices is harmful.""  Marketplace reached out to the four eyeglass retailers visited by producers.  Hudson's Bay Optical/Glasses Gallery said Marketplace was given wrong information when it comes to cancer and macular degeneration from digital blue light, and says it will be pulling all Vision Ease pamphlets and marketing materials immediately from all stores. It says all staff will be retrained in the coming weeks and it is ""committed to providing the very best experience for our customers."" Manufacturer Vision-Ease said they ""stand by their marketing materials"" and say the science around blue light is ""conflicting"" and ""ambiguous"" and more studies are needed.  LensCrafters said ""while we train our associates on all products, including blue light and blue IQ lenses, some inconsistencies are possible in how individual associates articulate this topic across our stores. We plan to reinforce our in-store training as the awareness around the potential risks of blue light grows."" Vogue Optical said ""optical science evolves very quickly"" and ""there is a high volume of ongoing studies on blue light, some of which point to damaging effects on the eye."" They also said they are putting considerable effort into educating staff to help educate consumers about what's available on the market and help them make the best choices.   Hakim Optical says there is evidence that blue light is damaging, and they ""will continue to respect and support the licensed optician's obligation to protect and educate the public with all available information and options related to their eye health care."" They also said ""there is no evidence of harm from the blue-light filter upgrade.""  Health Canada says prescription lenses are regulated through the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.   As the Food and Drugs Act ""prohibits false, misleading or deceptive advertising of a medical device, such as the promotion of claims without safety and effectiveness data,"" Health Canada said it will follow up with the optical chains to determine whether medical devices are being advertised or sold in Canada with unsupported health claims. The Ontario Opticians Association told Marketplace ""there is an overwhelming number of clients who have expressed satisfaction with their blue light filters, in that they reduced or eliminated headaches, fatigue, eyestrain and the like."" For people who are concerned about good eye health, Garg has some other suggestions — and they don't include lenses to block blue light.  ""Do things like take a break periodically, start quieting down before nighttime, eat a good diet, exercise and not smoke … all those things will help eyes way more than spending money on these blue blocking lenses.""  Sit about 63 centimetres (arm's length) from the computer screen. Position the screen so you are gazing slightly downward. Reduce screen glare by using a matte screen filter if needed. Take regular breaks using the ""20-20-20"" rule: every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet (six metres) away for at least 20 seconds. When your eyes feel dry, use artificial tears to refresh them. Adjust room lighting and try increasing the screen contrast to reduce eye strain. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing glasses.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-blue-light-lenses-hidden-camera-investigation-1.5364678,[],[]
389,Anonymous,2020-01-20T20:11:01.659Z,"SpaceX launches, destroys rocket in successful astronaut escape test","SpaceX completed the last big test of its crew capsule before launching astronauts in the next few months, mimicking an emergency escape shortly after liftoff Sunday. No one was aboard for the wild ride in the skies above Cape Canaveral, just two mannequins. The nine-minute flight ended with the Dragon crew capsule parachuting safely into the Atlantic, after separating and speeding away from the exploding rocket. ""I'm super fired up,"" Elon Musk, the company's founder and chief executive, told reporters. ""It's just going to be wonderful to get astronauts back into orbit from American soil after almost a decade of not being able to do so. That's just super exciting."" Crew Dragon separating from Falcon 9 during today’s test, which verified the spacecraft’s ability to carry astronauts to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent <a href=""https://t.co/rxUDPFD0v5"">pic.twitter.com/rxUDPFD0v5</a> NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Musk and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the next Crew Dragon could launch with a pair of NASA astronauts in the second quarter of this year — as early as April. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off as normal, but just over a minute into its supersonic flight, the Dragon crew capsule catapulted off the top 20 kilometres above the Atlantic. Powerful thrusters on the capsule propelled it up and out of harm's way, as the rocket engines deliberately shut down and the booster tumbled out of control and exploded in a giant fireball. The capsule reached an altitude of about 44 kilometres before parachuting into the ocean just offshore to bring the test flight to a close. Everything appeared to go well despite the choppy seas and overcast skies. Within minutes, a recovery ship was alongside the capsule. Recycled from three previous launches, the SpaceX rocket was destroyed as it burst apart in flight and slammed in pieces into the sea. SpaceX normally tries to recover its boosters to drive down launch costs, landing them upright on a floating platform or back at the launch site. NASA's commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders, said the launch abort test was ""our last open milestone"" before allowing SpaceX to launch Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the International Space Station. Their launch date will depend, in part, on whether NASA decides to keep them for months at the orbiting lab, versus just a week or two. A longer mission will require more training before flight. The astronauts monitored Sunday's flight from the firing room. Hurley said it was ""pretty neat to see"" the capsule aboard the recovery ship within two hours. By all early accounts, the test was successful. ""We'll see what the data show and go from there,"" Hurley said. ""But it certainly is a confidence builder from the standpoint if you ever got into that situation, that Dragon can get us away from the booster quickly."" The astronauts also will have access to speed before liftoff. During a launch dress rehearsal Friday, Hurley and Behnken rode in a white Tesla Model X from Kennedy Space Center's crew quarters to the launch pad, their sleek white and black spacesuits matching the electric sports car with wing-like doors. Musk, who also runs Tesla, used the cars to get around the space center Sunday. Delayed a day by bad weather, Sunday's launch from Kennedy brought together hundreds of SpaceX, NASA and Air Force employees on land, at sea and in the air. Tourists and locals alike packed the adjoining visitor complex and nearby beaches to see the dramatic fiery spectacle of an out-of-control rocket. Musk brought along his own family, including his brother. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing a decade ago to transport astronauts to and from the space station for billions of dollars. Both companies struggled with technical problems, adding years of delay and forcing NASA to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars extra for Russian rocket rides. After multiple cargo deliveries for NASA, SpaceX successfully flew an enhanced crew capsule to the space station last March without anyone on board, but it exploded a month later during ground testing. The emergency escape thrusters — the kind used in Sunday's test — had to be retooled. In all, SpaceX has tested these powerful Super Draco thrusters some 700 times. Last month, meanwhile, Boeing's Starliner crew capsule ended up in the wrong orbit on its first test flight and had to skip the space station. The previous month, only two of the Starliner's three parachutes deployed during a launch abort test. Lueders said it's too soon to know whether Boeing will need to send another Starliner to the space station without a crew or go straight to launching astronauts later this year. An investigation team is still looking into why the Starliner's automated timer was off by 11 hours during the December test flight. The importance of launch escape was demonstrated in 2018 when two astronauts, an American and a Russian, were pulled to safety during a failed launch from Kazakhstan. They experienced up to seven times the force of gravity during the abort, but walked away from the accident. The SpaceX in-flight abort system, Musk pointed out, should be gentler for the crew and is good from the launch pad all the way to orbit. Musk said the Dragon's escape system should work — in principle — even if the capsule is still attached when the rocket erupts in a fireball. He said that could look like ""something out of Star Wars"" with the capsule flying right out of a fireball. ""Obviously we want to avoid doing that,"" he quickly added, taking note of all the NASA personnel around him.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-capsule-escape-1.5433125,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-girlfriend-spacex-voyage-1.5424094 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boeing-starliner-crew-capsule-1.5403868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-dragon-1.5048241,/news/world/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-girlfriend-spacex-voyage-1.5424094 /news/technology/boeing-starliner-investigation-1.5420395 /news/technology/boeing-starliner-crew-capsule-1.5403868 /news/technology/spacex-crew-dragon-1.5048241 /news/technology/spacex-dragon-crew-capsule-loss-nasa-florida-1.5106721

But as a new work week begins, close to 425 military members will be in the area by Tuesday afternoon, and snow-clearing operations continue, states of emergency in a number of municipalities restrict what residents can and cannot do. Here's what you need to know to stay safe (and within the law). The City of St. John's allowed some pharmacies to open Monday, and said all stores selling basic food — like grocery stores and convenience stores — will be allowed to open Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ""This excludes bars, restaurants, fast food chains and outlets,"" the city said in a statement sent 12:45 p.m. Monday.  ""Residents, please be prepared to purchase enough food for your family for 48 hours."" The city asked people travelling to stores to be extremely careful, and asked motorists to drive slowly. Operations in Conception Bay South, Random Island West, Wabana, Green's Harbour, Norman's Cove-Long Cove and Chapel Arm have been permitted to go back to normal since they ended their states of emergency over the weekend.  Under the various states of emergency, residents are strongly urged to remain indoors, off the streets and sidewalks, to allow snow-clearing operations to carry on unimpeded.  ⚠️UPDATE⚠️ Patrol Services have passed along that there were <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nltraffic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nltraffic</a> checks completed in the last 24 hours which resulted in tickets being issued in connection with failure to comply with a state of emergency.

The year 2020 might look like a new year on paper but in many ways it's going to feel mighty old mighty quick. At least when it comes to Alberta politics. Many of the big issues from the past year will continue to dominate the new. Let's look at a few. Yes, it didn't take a crystal ball to figure this one out. Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives won the election on a promise of a strong economy and more jobs. It didn't work out that way and the NDP has been gleefully rubbing it in Kenney's face every chance they get. And they'll keep it up in 2020 as the UCP government tries to kick-start the economy and create jobs. Economists predict ""modest growth"" in the province's economy for the new year. Kenney will need to do better than that if he hopes to mute the critics — and claim ""promise made, promise kept"" in 2020. If there's one issue that has defined Alberta politics, this is it. Getting a new energy pipeline to tidewater has become an overwrought symbol of Alberta's dreams and frustrations — the dream of another energy boom and the frustration at failing to get a new pipeline built. In fact, a new pipeline will not solve our fiscal problems that are actually caused by a depressed price of oil and a world moving away from fossil fuels. And delays in getting a new pipeline built are not the fault of the federal Liberal government, as Premier Jason Kenney likes to suggest, but the courts. And the courts have delayed projects because of genuine complaints from First Nations. Work has started on twinning the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that work will continue through 2020 (and for two years after that) but the project will still face opposition from some First Nations and environmental groups. This will be a win-win for Kenney. If construction continues on TMX, he can point to it as a ""victory"" for his government; if it doesn't, he can blame the federal Liberals and ""foreign-funded"" environmental organizations for continuing to undermine Alberta's struggling economy. Speaking of blaming others for Alberta's ills, 2020 will see the UCP government maintain its pugilistic approach to issues via its Fight Back Strategy that includes the ""war room"" — officially, the Canadian Energy Centre — the public inquiry into the government's foreign-funded conspiracy theory, and the ""fair deal"" panel that is looking into whether Alberta should have, for example, its own police force and pension plan. Alberta energy 'war room' discovers its logo was lifted from American software company These are all tactics designed to keep Alberta on a war footing and keep Albertans angry, frustrated and easily manipulated by a government that equates legitimate opposition with sedition. The past year ended with some frustrated public sector workers musing about a general strike. That strike never happened and perhaps it never will. But we might see strikes by individual public sector unions in 2020. They are upset by a government that is pressing workers to take wage cuts. The government has made it clear if the unions win wage hikes, they can expect job cuts. Perhaps the government was peering into its own crystal ball this fall when it passed a piece of legislation giving it the right to hire replacement workers in the event of a public sector strike. In 2019, the UCP government commissioned a long list of panels and committees to review everything from the $20-billion Alberta Health Services, to car insurance rates, to safe consumption sites. The granddaddy of them all was the blue ribbon panel that issued a report that formed the basis for the government's cost-cutting budget that rolled out in October. Alberta's 'fair deal' panel begins feedback tour with Edmonton town hall Those panels — with members and mandates carefully chosen by the government — will continue to influence government policy throughout 2020. That includes Budget 2020 coming in late February, which will actually be the first true UCP budget. The 2019 budget, introduced in an election year, was an amalgam of UCP policies and leftovers from the previous NDP budget. There won't be an election in 2020 but you're going to feel like you're trapped in a nasty election campaign anyway. The animosity between the UCP government and NDP opposition isn't just political, it's personal. Kenney has gone to great lengths to dismantle the former NDP government's legacy and the NDP sees Kenney as a right-wing bully. The mutual antagonism will continue as Kenney has already promised even more sweeping legislation in the spring session. Kenney's popularity took a substantial hit late in 2019, according to several public opinion polls, because of a sputtering economy and cuts to government services. But it appears he doesn't plan to stop or change direction. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" he told cheering UCP members at their convention a few weeks ago. ""We're just getting started."" In one of the few times NDP leader Rachel Notley agreed with Kenney in 2019, she told a year-end interview she doesn't think Kenney is about to ease up on the gas pedal in 2020: ""There's nothing that makes me believe that they're going to change course and I think they're going to push harder.""

""Look what happened to our caribou ...15 or 10 years ago caribou were thick like mosquitoes."" The Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council is asking the provincial government to put in place a moratorium on the 2020 moose hunt in the réserve faunique La Vérendrye, south of Val-d'Or, saying hunters are seeing steep declines in the population.  Last week, the council issued a press release saying it was disappointed the ministry was refusing to act so far. ""The moose population is going down fairly quickly,"" said Algonquin Anishinabeg Grand Chief Verna Polson. ""We've been talking about this for several years now."" Polson said her nation is co-operating with officials at the province's Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs to carry out a moose population count in the reserve this winter. The nation is continuing to pressure the government for a moratorium.  The Cree Trappers Association is hoping to present its draft moose management plan to members at its annual general assembly this summer. It will include a better population count and draw on traditional Cree and non-Indigenous conservation practices, and could include restrictions on Indigenous hunters, according to association president Tomatuk. He also said hunters need to stop over-harvesting, particularly female moose during the spring calving season. ""In Waswanipi last year, nine moose were killed,"" said Tomatuk, adding all were female and pregnant. That one harvest took a total of 27 moose out of the area, he said. ""To make a management plan successful. We're going to have to really start concentrating on not shooting females.""

The airline announced Friday in Charlottetown it will expand what it calls its seasonal service between the two cities starting June 25 and ending Sept. 7. ""Our partners in both P.E.I.and Alberta are excited with the opportunity this service represents as both have a new opportunity to market their world-class tourism assets,"" said Charles Duncan, chief strategy officer for WestJet, in a written news release Friday. ""This direct flight between P.E.I and Alberta will further strengthen our relationship with Western Canada,"" said P.E.I. Premier Dennis King in the release. The flights from Calgary to Charlottetown will depart at 10:45 p.m. and arrive at 6:23 a.m. four times weekly. Flights from Charlottetown to Calgary will leave at 7:15 a.m. and arrive at 9:33 a.m. four times weekly. ""I think it opens up opportunities for Tourism PEI and others to start to market P.E.I. right across the country and especially obviously in the Alberta area,"" said Doug Newson, CEO of the Charlottetown Airport Authority. ""Open up new possibilities for tourists to come here and make it easier maybe for those people that want to travel west."" ""Altogether it'll be a 35 per cent increase in the number of seats that WestJet will fly into Charlottetown,"" Duncan said. WestJet said the flights are timed to connect with destinations in Western Canada including Vancouver, Edmonton, Kelowna and Victoria. Duncan said that will give Islanders easier access to a number of other destinations as well. ""We have almost 200 flights a day to dozens of destinations in Calgary,"" said Duncan. ""If people are going to Edmonton … or any of dozens of other places. This will be the fastest way to get there and I think people will be impressed with the pricing they see as well."" It's been something that WestJet and the Charlottetown Airport have been working on for at least three years, said Duncan.  ""We have been seeing gradually, over the past several years, the number … of our guests on the airplane from Calgary and Alberta coming to Charlottetown increasing,"" he said. ""This is the year that we actually see enough demand that we can actually maintain our service from Toronto and the non-stop flights from Calgary.""  Newson said he thinks tourism will be the main driver of seat sales for the new flight.  ""I don't think we do a lot of marketing in the Alberta market right now and one of those reasons probably is because it is so far and we don't have that non-stop direct air access,"" he said. ""Now that we have that, I think you'll probably see a bit more focus on the Alberta market especially in the Calgary area because it's more convenient to get here.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-westjet-charlottetown-calgary-jan-2020-1.5430670,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-swoop-charlottetown-airport-1.5420416 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-airport-therapy-dogs-1.5385440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-addictions-services-more-jan-2020-1.5429783 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-lands-protection-act-committee-presentation-horace-carver-1.5429611,[]

He was using his latte art talent to raise money for the emergency out-of-the-cold shelter in the city. Leonard, now living in Toronto, travels the world making latte art for celebrities, working high-profile gigs at the Oscars and the Emmys. ""Meryl Streep called me a genius, so like, I don't know how it will ever get better than that — truly,"" Leonard said Sunday in Fredericton.  Leonard uses food colouring to paint a picture on steamed milk. The image lasts a few minutes, but he said it's just as much about the experience as the final product. ""It's like we get to have a latte together,"" Leonard said, who sits and chats with the person receiving his work. Leonard made latte art for people in his hometown Sunday at a downtown coffee shop. People paid by donation to have Leonard paint for them. Some people asked him to paint pictures of pets and others, like Nicole Wilby, had her face sketched. ""Artists tend to have different mediums, and it's super fun that his medium is something you get to enjoy after as well,"" Wilby said.  She was impressed with Leonard's ability to capture her character in the latte. ""Green eyes, headband, flushed cheeks,"" Wilby said looking at her latte before she started to sip on the hot drink. Leonard said he works about five or six celebrity events each year and he's expecting to do just as many, or more, this year.  But doing Sunday's fundraiser was important for him. ""Coming back to Fredericton as an adult, you see the people who need help on the street are not strangers but they're people I grew up with sometimes,"" Leonard said. ""I just feel so grateful that I can use the platform and voice I have to build community here and raise awareness around the homeless population here."" Later this week, Leonard's headed to Utah for his fourth consecutive Sundance Film Festival, which he said is like going back to summer camp.  ""You'll see a lot of the same celebrity faces, but also all the other people in the room — the publicists, the hairstylists, the makeup artists, so it's really nice to come together a few times a year and get to see each other and catch up.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-barista-brian-fundraiser-1.5432669,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-s-barista-brian-travels-the-world-making-latte-art-for-celebrities-1.5395727 https://www.cbc.ca/arts/how-to-make-the-most-beautiful-latte-art-ever-from-easy-to-extra-adventurous-1.4178837,/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-s-barista-brian-travels-the-world-making-latte-art-for-celebrities-1.5395727 /arts/how-to-make-the-most-beautiful-latte-art-ever-from-easy-to-extra-adventurous-1.4178837
395,Mesfin Fekadu,2020-01-17T15:28:29.167Z,New Grammys CEO put on leave 10 days before awards show,"The Recording Academy has placed its president and CEO Deborah Dugan on administrative leave following an allegation of misconduct by a senior leader at the organization and less than two weeks before its annual Grammy Awards. Dugan, the academy's leader of just six months, has fired back via a statement from her lawyer, saying ""what has been reported is not nearly the story that needs to be told. ""When our ability to speak is not restrained by a 28-page contract and legal threats, we will expose what happens when you 'step up' at the Recording Academy, a public nonprofit,"" read a statement released Friday to The Associated Press by Dugan's attorney, Bryan Freedman. Dugan, the former CEO of Bono's (RED) organization, became the first woman appointed to lead the academy when she began the job in August. Before joining (RED), she was president of Disney Publishing Worldwide and executive vice-president at EMI/Capitol Records. She started her career as an attorney on Wall Street. Dugan's hire came after Neil Portnow chose not to seek an extension on his contract. Portnow had led the Grammys since 2002, but was criticized for saying women need to ""step up"" when asked about the lack of female winners at the 2018 Grammys during a backstage interview. That year, only two female performers won awards during the live telecast and the Grammys were criticized for not giving pop singer Lorde, the only women nominated for album of the year, a performance slot at the show. Recording Academy Board chair Harvey Mason Jr., a music producer who has worked with Chris Brown, Jennifer Hudson and more, will serve as interim president and CEO of the academy. ""In light of concerns raised to the Recording Academy Board of Trustees, including a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team, the board has placed Recording Academy president and CEO Deborah Dugan on administrative leave, effective immediately,"" the academy said in a statement to the Associated Press. ""The board has also retained two independent third-party investigators to conduct independent investigations of the allegations. ""The board determined this action to be necessary in order to restore the confidence of the Recording Academy's membership, repair Recording Academy employee morale and allow the Recording Academy to focus on its mission of serving all music creators,"" the statement continued. ""The Recording Academy Board of Trustees is committed to fostering a safe, diverse, and inclusive workplace, music industry and society."" Before Dugan, music executive Christine Farnon held the top position at the academy for years though she never had the title of president and CEO. She held multiple positions at the Grammys throughout her tenure, retiring in 1992 as executive vice president. Michael Greene became the first official president and CEO of the academy in 1988, leading the organization until 2002, when Portnow took over. This year's Grammys, set to air Jan. 26 from Los Angeles, is slated to feature performances by Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, Tyler, the Creator, Run-DMC, Rosalia, H.E.R. and Lizzo, who is the top nominee with eight nods.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/deborah-dugan-administrative-leave-1.5430573,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grammy-female-representation-1.4510037 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grammys-2019-what-to-know-1.5012964,/news/entertainment/deborah-dugan-grammys-1.5129355 /news/entertainment/grammy-noms-snubs-1.5366045 /news/entertainment/grammys-2019-moments-1.5013656
396,Anonymous,2020-01-19T18:56:22.457Z,"Halifax bookstore event, vaccine survey ads blocked by Facebook","Facebook is backtracking after blocking ads promoting a Nova Scotia Health Authority survey about vaccines and a book event in Halifax with journalist Desmond Cole about his experience as a black man in Canada.  The company said it erred when it refused to promote the ads.  This week, Facebook cited to the health authority and the university bookstore relatively new rules pertaining to events that are deemed to promote social issues, elections or politics. In each case, it gave the Facebook page's administrator the option of submitting identification to be verified.  Paul MacKay, who manages the King's Co-op Bookstore and its Facebook account, said he would've been fine submitting an address and phone number but drew that line at a photo ID. ""I just don't want to put all my information on the Internet,"" he said. ""Facebook has proven to not be a terribly trustworthy company on top of that.""  The bookstore's event in question is a Feb. 13 book launch for Cole and his new book The Skin We're In, which documents his encounters with police and racial profiling. The bookstore was using a description of the book that came from its publisher.  MacKay said he had never seen anything like this happen with other events.  ""It just seems a little on the nose, especially with Desmond who's had his own troubles with police consistently documented,"" he said. ""It definitely presents, creates a barrier to anyone trying to document this type of thing for anyone who is uncomfortable with Facebook having all their information, or being the arbiter of what is allowed and what is not allowed to be out there."" The Nova Scotia Health Authority ran into the same problem while trying to boost an ad about a survey that discussed immunizations for children. The aim was to understand why parents of children born after 2011 chose to immunize, or not immunize, their children. It was part of a national project that aims to bring Nova Scotia's immunization rates up to the national target of 95 per cent.  John Gillis, who speaks for the Nova Scotia Health Authority and is an administrator on its Facebook page, said the authority had ""no political intentions at all.""  ""It's part of the work we do,"" he said. ""We've run a very similar ad for it in the recent past. But when we tried to do it this week, Facebook rejected it, considering health to be a social issue."" Gillis said a nearly identical ad published about a month ago had no issues. But this time Facebook wanted him to submit scans of a passport, driver's licence or government ID in order for the post to be authenticated. He declined.  In a statement to CBC, Facebook said it instituted a policy last year it said was aimed to create more transparency. It said it now requires people running ads about social issues, politics or elections to be identified and that the ad includes disclaimers on who or what entity paid for it.  It says anyone submitting ads regarding civil and social rights, environmental politics, economy, health, immigration, political values and governance and security and foreign policy must be authenticated by the company.  MacKay said the bookstore would try to promote Cole's book reading through word of mouth and more traditional ways. He said in the future he won't be trying to boost any other events on Facebook.

397,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-25T19:22:58.757Z,'We would have been dead': Father outraged after engine fire puts family at risk,"Chris Dietrich, his wife and three young children were asleep when they woke up to a neighbour pounding on the door to tell them flames were shooting out of their garage and closing in on the house. The engine in the family's 2015 Hyundai Tucson had spontaneously burst into flames while parked in the garage. ""If it weren't for our neighbours, we would have likely been dead,"" Dietrich, from Ayr, Ont., told Go Public. ""If it were 10 to 15 minutes later it would have hit our gas line to our gas barbecue."" The fire broke out in the early morning hours of Feb. 4, after the vehicle had been parked for hours.  The company Dietrich hired to investigate found the fire started in the engine, but couldn't definitively determine why it started.  Dietrich is not the only one with an engine fire horror story. Since Go Public first broke the story about delayed recalls on Hyundai and Kia vehicles for possible engine problems, CBC News has been bombarded with stories of spontaneous vehicle fires and catastrophic engine failures.     George Iny from the Automobile Protection Association credits that CBC News investigation with pressuring the South Korean carmakers into action. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to determine if the carmakers were too slow to fix faulty vehicles. ""We dragged some of [our belongings] out and then we watched it burn until the fire trucks got there,"" Michielsen told Go Public from his home in Coaldale, Alta. ""I got away lucky because we weren't injured.""  Michielsen's vehicle has been subject to two engine recalls for different reasons. The first was in January 2018. He says his local Kia dealer inspected his engine and told him it was fine.  A few months later, the engine stalled and had to be replaced — only to catch fire earlier this month.  When he got home, he found a second recall notice in the mail. The latest recall brings the total number of recalled Hyundai and Kia vehicles to almost three million in North America since 2015.  The recalls have been for different defects that could lead to engine failures and fires, which is a problem, according to Gretchen Freeman Cappio, a U.S. lawyer who is leading one of several lawsuits south of the border over engine fires.  ""There are numerous problems with these vehicles [in which] the companies admit they have a recall but they don't have a fix … which is astounding when you say it out loud,"" Freeman Cappio said from her office in Seattle. Hyundai has the second highest number of engine fire reports among carmakers in the country — 21 over the past three years, according to Transport Canada. The company was seventh in car sales last year, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. Hyundai says it only has five confirmed cases of engine fires resulting from engine failures — saying that is a tiny fraction of the estimated number of its vehicles on the road.  Transport Canada has had three fire reports related to Kia engines, but the automaker wouldn't say how many it has recorded. Following Go Public's investigation into the 2.0L and 2.4L Theta II engines, Hyundai and Kia Canada did more in a couple of weeks than they have done since the recalls started four years ago. Kia added 79,301 vehicles to its recall list and Hyundai added 255,370 — more than double since the recalls started. Hyundai is also extending warranties for those vehicles. Hyundai says it's doing that ""out of an abundance of caution."" The Automobile Protection Association's Iny calls the warranty extensions ""a very big offer"" and says he's pleased with how Hyundai is stepping up action after Go Public's investigation.   ""That's a big development for consumers,"" he said. In a written response to Go Public's investigation, Hyundai Auto Canada says ""nothing is more important to Hyundai than the safety and security of our customers.""  ""Hyundai takes engine fires with the utmost urgency and seriousness. It is Hyundai's policy to investigate each and every engine fire that is brought to its attention,"" the statement reads.  Kia says ""when the result of any engine failure or fire is due to a vehicle manufacturing issue, Kia will conduct a voluntary recall,"" adding it ""continuously evaluates all Kia models … [and] if a safety defect is detected … Kia promptly reports a safety related defect to Transport Canada."" Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a potential safety-related condition with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Owners wanting to check if their vehicles are under a recall can do that on the Hyundai and Kia websites.

398,Erica Johnson,2019-05-27T19:20:39.139Z,Man with severe asthma says new police powers unfair for people unable to do breath test,"LATEST UPDATE | After this story was published, the RCMP sent another statement to Go Public, saying the force's national impaired driving policy is based on the Criminal Code. The available options to screen for impaired drivers are legislated by Parliament, it said, and police are not permitted to use alternatives. If a driver feels they had a lawful excuse for failing to comply with an impairment-screening test, ""they are encouraged to speak with legal counsel and consider bringing their concerns before the courts,"" the statement said. A B.C. man with severe breathing issues who recently had his car impounded and driver's licence suspended — twice — says new rules that allow police across the country to pull over any vehicle and force the driver to take a breath test are causing undue hardship for people who cannot blow into a breathalyzer. Jimmy Forster, 63, suffers from severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and takes daily medications to help him breathe. He lives in the small village of Chase — population 2,300 — in the B.C. Interior. In recent months, Chase RCMP have pulled Forster over twice and charged him with failing to provide a breath sample, after he was unable to blow hard enough into a breathalyzer device to register a reading. ""I'm just totally stressed right now,"" says Forster, who has an audible wheeze when he speaks and slightly slurred speech due to a childhood brain injury that also left him with a limp. He's on a disability pension, but is now on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get his car out of impound and his driver's licence reinstated, and says he has no idea how he will pay. There are almost 200,000 Canadians living with severe asthma and more than two million people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the Canadian Lung Association. Thousands of others have disabilities — such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis caused by stroke — that may make them unable to perform a breath test, causing concern for human rights advocates. ""I think it's important that the police consider human rights principles,"" says Dylan Mazur, a lawyer with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, ""including the duty to accommodate people with disabilities who can't provide a roadside test."" A spokesperson with the RCMP's national headquarters, Sgt. Marie Damian, did not respond when Go Public asked whether a specific policy exists to provide an alternative for people with disabilities who can't do a breathalyzer test. In an email she wrote, ""The determination as to whether the subject was 'able and unwilling' or 'legitimately unable' to provide a sample will be up to the investigating officer."" ""The actual volume and force of breath required for a sample is not significant."" Forster says his first police run-in occurred when he was returning from a trip to the post office on the afternoon of Feb. 14, and an RCMP officer pulled him over and accused him of not wearing a seatbelt. Forster says he was belted in. The officer decided to employ the alcohol screening powers that came into effect on Dec. 18, 2018, granting police the right to demand a breath sample from any driver they pull over. In the past, police couldn't require a roadside breath test unless they had a reasonable suspicion that a driver had consumed alcohol. In B.C., any driver who refuses — or, like Forster, fails to provide a breath sample — faces an immediate roadside prohibition (IRP), where their licence is suspended and their vehicle towed, even though there is no evidence of any alcohol consumption. In other provinces, drivers face a potential criminal charge for refusing to blow. Forster says he blew into the breathalyzer device, but couldn't get a reading. He says he explained that he has severe asthma, but the officer didn't believe him. ""He just said, 'Blow harder! Blow harder!'"" says Forster, who says he tried about a dozen times to breathe deeply into the device, and thought he was going to fall over because he was getting dizzy. The RCMP officer issued an IRP, despite a lack of any evidence that Forster was impaired. ""I just couldn't believe it,"" says Forster, whose doctor told Go Public his patient has no history of a drinking problem.   Forster appealed to an adjudicator, submitting his medical records. The adjudicator dismissed the case and Forster got his licence back and his car out of impound, without financial penalty. A few weeks later, on the morning of March 20, police pulled Forster over again, just after he'd gone for a haircut and filled up his car at a gas station. ""He [the officer] didn't ask me any questions,"" says Forster. ""He just brought the breathalyzer and I blew five to six times and had the same thing happen again."" This time, Forster says, he asked the officer if he could take a blood test instead. ""He totally ignored me,"" says Forster. ""Just in one ear, out the other."" Once again, police impounded Forster's car and suspended his licence for 90 days. When he appealed a second time, an adjudicator said he believed police notes that said Forster was ""putting on a show"" to make it look as though he was unable to provide a breath sample. The notes do not claim that Forster appeared to have been drinking, smelled of alcohol, or was driving poorly. ""I was so choked,"" says Forster, who faces about $1,400 in fees to get his car released from impound and his licence back next month. He has already spent $200 each time he appealed the IRPs. Forster lives with his cousin Sandy Johnston, who relies on him to drive her places since having a stroke 10 years ago. ""I'm totally dependent on Jimmy,"" she says. ""After his car got taken the second time, he was just in tears. And then I broke into tears, too. And we were crying together."" A leading researcher on lung disease says assessing whether or not someone's lung function is adequate to obtain a breathalyzer reading is not something that can be easily done in the field. ""The concern I have is that there likely are people that have lung function that's so low that they can't do the tests,"" says Dr. Christopher Carlsten, division head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of the Occupational Lung Disease Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. He says viral infections and other stressors, such as being pulled over by police, can affect the breathing capacity of someone with compromised lungs. Go Public has tracked down other cases in B.C. — as well as in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick — in which people with disabilities say they struggled to provide a breathalyzer test. One of the more prominent cases has prompted a charter challenge against mandatory alcohol screening. Norma McLeod, 76, of Victoria, was pulled over on Feb. 14, and says she was unable to provide a breath sample due to a chronic lung condition and an implant in the roof of her mouth that's a result of cancer. Police towed her car and suspended her licence. ""It's happening more frequently now that the federal government has introduced the provision which permits mandatory alcohol screening based on absolutely no suspicion of alcohol consumption,"" says criminal lawyer Jennifer Teryn, part of the legal team representing McLeod. ""If someone's unable to provide a sample upon demand, it's my position that the police should have to get engaged in some minor investigation to find out for themselves whether there's a legitimate reason for that or not,"" says Teryn. Mazur says he also expects police to ask people whether they have a disability preventing them from complying with a roadside breath test demand. ""I've heard this from people with disabilities who have mobility issues or who have speech issues — that they can be perceived as intoxicated,"" says Mazur. ""What the RCMP has to do is look at their policies, and look at whether there are provisions of reasonable accommodation based on disability."" Go Public asked Mike Farnworth, B.C.'s minister of public safety and solicitor general, about the difficulties some people with disabilities have  providing breath tests. In a statement, Farnworth wrote, ""I plan to raise these concerns with my federal counterparts. In addition, I've asked my staff to research whether there are any amendments that could be made to the immediate roadside prohibition appeal process in these situations, including options to reduce any financial barriers for requesting a review."" His ministry said that of 2,558 IRP reviews conducted last year, 491 were dismissed. The office could not determine how many of the cases were dismissed due to disability or medical issues. Jimmy Forster is due to get his driver's licence back on June 20, but says he's anxious police will keep pulling him over. ""I can't afford it, I'm on disability,"" says Forster. ""I can't sleep at night."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web. We tell your stories and hold the powers that be accountable.

399,Stephen David Cook,2020-01-18T13:00:00.217Z,Research details different accents across the Prairies,"Travel from Edmonton to Lethbridge, Alta. and you might notice locals speak a little differently. That's what a linguistics student at the University of Alberta has discovered as part of ongoing research.  Student Bryce Wittrock, 23, looked at the differences in dialect between Prairie provinces. In a paper published in the Canadian Acoustics journal, data shows measurable differences in certain vowel pronunciations between ""southern Alberta and Saskatchewan English"" and ""Edmonton English."" One example from Wittrock's research is the pronunciation of ""fired."" He found that in Edmonton, many pronounce the word differently than those in rural, southern Saskatchewan. ""That's an environment where a lot of previous studies wouldn't expect to find that,"" Wittrock said Friday. ""Not everyone pronounces those words like that all the time, but it's a really fun example and something that future work is definitely going to be on."" Wittrock spent the summer driving around southern Alberta and Saskatchewan to record audio from 24 native English speakers, getting people to say certain words and phrases. He also struck up conversations with them and compared the results to samples from a previous study using students who grew up in or near Edmonton. ""When I moved to Edmonton for school, I wondered if people in my new home speak like they do at my old home,"" said Wittrock, who hails from Medicine Hat. ""I had an opportunity through studying linguistics to actually make this a study and find out with actual measurements and computers."" Some of the sound differences the project has identified includes vowels like the short 'i' in ""hid"" or ""pig"" and the short 'e' sound in ""head"" or ""bed,"" he said. ""Those two sounds are more distinct — different from each other — in Edmonton than they are from the southern speakers,"" Wittrock said. English dialects in Canada are spread over larger distances compared to a country like the United Kingdom because of the country's history, according to Wittrock. Settlers and colonists brought their accents to Canada and people carried those ways of speaking across the country, he said. ""But over time, when different kinds of social circles don't interact with each other as much anymore, that's when they kind of drift apart and change,"" Wittrock said. Benjamin Tucker, U of A linguistics professor and the paper's co-author, said there has been little work done comparing communities in southern Alberta. ""There's no kind of comparison looking at how southern Alberta is different from other parts of Alberta or Saskatchewan or British Columbia or any number of places,"" he said. Canadian dialects are generally grouped into three or five categories, according to the research paper. They include an inland/Prairie dialect that roughly covers the area from the Rocky Mountains to northern/Western Ontario. ""The Prairie provinces are more interesting than maybe we thought before,"" Tucker said. ""We're not all the same. There's a lot of different groups and variability in the groups that are really interesting. ""Over the long-term, hopefully we'll learn something about how we build identity and how we tie language into what that identity is."" Wittrock said it's too early to say why differences exist, although possibilities include an urban/rural divide or job differences. ""What that actual variable is that the change depends on is something that we'll hopefully learn as more data gets analyzed."" The study forms the basis of Wittrock's honors thesis. In his final year of an undergraduate degree, the linguistics major just finished applications for graduate school days ago. ""I'm enjoying research very much and it's something that I would love to continue doing,"" he said. ""I would love to make a career out of learning more about language variation and change.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/study-different-accents-alberta-1.5431783,[],[]
400,Jordan Press,2020-01-18T16:53:32.167Z,Auditor General reviewing federal government's handling of student loans program,"Canada's auditor general is examining how the government manages billions of dollars in the Canada Student Loans program, and whether it's helping students be smarter about their financial decisions, newly disclosed documents show. The audit, expected by April, will look at how efficiently two departments involved in the program — Employment and Social Development Canada, and the Canada Revenue Agency — have managed ""risks to the public treasury"" in doling out cash to students. Another item in the audit will be the departments' ""collection activities of student loans,"" and a third line of inquiry will assess how well the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada has worked to improve students' financial literacy. While the auditor general's report won't be out for weeks, high-level details of the audit are in a briefing note obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act. The document prepared for the top civil servant at Employment and Social Development Canada notes that work on the audit has been underway since May 2019. The auditor general's office generally doesn't comment on reviews until they become public and declined to discuss this one, calling it ""premature"" to do so. Likewise, ESDC said in a statement it wasn't ""at liberty to disclose information pertaining to an ongoing audit,"" while the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada listed its efforts, including resources offered to classroom teachers and financial-aid offices, when asked for any data on how well the agency has performed. Outstanding federal student loans total about $17 billion, and the federal government regularly gives up on collecting some of them — because a person who owes the money files for bankruptcy, the debt passes a six-year legal limit on collections or the debtor can't be found. Instruction in financial literacy needs to happen long before students arrive at colleges and universities, but it's not the sole solution for helping those in debt, said Trina James, national treasurer for the Canadian Federation of Students. She said she hopes the next federal budget will shift spending to reduce education costs directly. ""When we're looking at why a lot of students are defaulting on loans, it's not because they're not able to manage their money, it's mainly because a lot of the costs associated to accessing post-secondary education continue to rise,"" James said, citing the cost of textbooks and living expenses. New rules kicked in Nov. 1, 2019, that the Liberals hope will ease some of that burden, including a six-month, interest-free grace period on repaying loans after graduation and a drop in interest rates. And as of Jan. 1, the government allows those in arrears to spread out interest payments, which ESDC said in a statement should reduce debt write-offs. The department cautioned that ""it is too early to assess the impact of these initiatives,"" but noted officials collected $195.7 million from debtors last fiscal year compared to $192.2 million in the preceding 12 months. Adam Brown, board chair for the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (a rival to the Canadian Federation of Students in representing post-secondary students), said the program has improved in recent years to help students repay loans, but suggested a deeper look at other ideas like extending the interest-free grace period, ensuring students have solid finances before being asked to repay their loans and targeted help to parents who are in school. ""Some of those things are going to make the program and make collections a little more complicated for the federal government, but at the end of the day, those are very, very worthwhile changes that are going to make repaying those loans in itself a lot easier for Canadians,"" Brown said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/audit-canada-student-loans-1.5432110,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/student-debt-loans-interest-credit-expert-1.5028057 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/facebook-students-loans-interest-1.4671304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-forgive-student-loans-again-1.3982728 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/student-loans-write-off-1.4539426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/student-loans-write-off-1.4539426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-will-promise-a-student-loan-repayment-break-for-new-parents-report-1.5301769,/news/politics/liberals-will-promise-a-student-loan-repayment-break-for-new-parents-report-1.5301769 /news/canada/british-columbia/student-debt-loans-interest-credit-expert-1.5028057

402,Anonymous,2020-01-21T01:01:10.933Z,Hundreds of Central American migrants cross river into Mexico,"Hundreds of Central American migrants waded across the Suchiate River into southern Mexico Monday in a new test of U.S. President Donald Trump's Central America strategy to keep them away from the U.S. border. Some scuffled with national guardsmen on the riverbank while others slipped through Mexican lines and trudged off on a rural highway in small groups. Immigration authorities nabbed more there and chased others into the brush. Most, however, remained at the river's edge or stood in its muddy waters trying to decide what to do next, after being blocked from crossing en masse over the border bridge leading to Ciudad Hidalgo. ""Mexico's president said he would give us work and an opportunity and look,"" said Esther Madrid, a Honduran vendor who left her six children in Honduras. Sitting on a rock among dozens of people who didn't know what to do next, she offered only one word when asked if she would consider returning to San Pedro Sula: ""Never."" Mexico's strategy, developed after the first migrant caravan in late 2018, to break up the mass of people repeatedly and into increasingly smaller groups appeared to be working. Over the weekend, government officials convinced about 1,000 people they should enter legally over the border bridge. On Monday, migrants were detained at the river and along the highway. Those who continued could expect a gauntlet of highway checkpoints while trying to move north. After the river crossing Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute issued a statement saying that it would detain any migrants without legal status, hold them in detention centres and deport those who did not legalize their status. As feared, children suffered most in the clashes. A 14-year-old girl was carried from the Mexican riverbank unconscious. It was unclear what had happened but a guardsman said she had been convulsing. Later along the highway, a mother sobbed after realizing her youngest daughter had been separated when migrants tried to escape authorities. Sauri Marubeny Ortega had been walking with her four daughters, ages five to 16. Another migrant who had been helping her by carrying the five-year-old ran in another direction when the migrants scattered and she hadn't been able to locate them. ""When the federales' cars began arriving, he ran off that way and I took off after him,"" she said. But when she saw an agent nab another daughter she didn't know who to help and lost sight of the youngest. ""I just beg the person who has her to leave her in a safe place and tell the police,"" the mother said as members of Mexico's migrant assistance force, Grupo Beta, loaded her and three of her girls into an ambulance. ""I don't want to leave here without my daughter."" WATCH | Migrants cross river from Guatemala into Mexico: The migrants started the day on the border bridge connecting Guatemala and Mexico, where they read aloud a letter asking Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for permission to cross Mexico en route to the U.S. border. Mexican officials replied that free passage would not be offered. They urged the migrants to enter legally, registering at the bridge and seeking protection and work permits if they wished to remain in Mexico. It was an offer many migrants viewed with suspicion. That sent the migrants down to the Suchiate where hundreds forded its shallow waters and soon faced guardsmen. On the Mexican side, migrants ran from side to side along the river bank, kicking up dust and looking for an opening in the ranks of National Guard troops sent to meet them. Guardsmen scrambled too, trying to head off groups and detaining people where they could. There was pushing and shoving. Some guardsmen carried plastic riot shields hit with rocks tossed by migrants and they occasionally zipped a rock back into the crowd. Others jogged to get into position with long staffs. Still others carried assault rifles. Many of migrants moved back to the river's edge and a smaller number crossed back to Guatemala. ""You have two options: You go back to Guatemalan territory or you come with us,"" Mexican immigration agents said to migrants who had crossed the river. They assured those who went with them that they would ""regularize"" their status, but few of the migrants believed them. Riot police with shields also appeared on the Guatemala side of river, raising questions about what options really remained for the migrants. While Mexico's government says the migrants are free to enter — and could compete for jobs if they want to stay and work — in practice, it has restricted such migrants to the southernmost states while their cases are processed by a sluggish bureaucracy. Those who do not request asylum or some protective status would likely be detained and deported. Trump has forced asylum seekers to remain in Mexico, or apply in Central American countries, effectively removing one of the escape valves for previous caravans. Under threats of trade or other sanctions from the Trump administration, Mexico has stopped an earlier practice of allowing migrants to cross its territory unimpeded. The Guatemala government issued new data Monday showing that 4,000 migrants crossed into the country through the two primary crossings used by the migrants last week, and over the weekend nearly 1,700 entered Mexico at two crossings. It said 400 were deported from Guatemala. After two caravans successfully reached the U.S. border in 2018 and early 2019, Mexico began cracking down, and by April 2019 raided the last attempt at a caravan, rounding up migrants as they walked down a highway. As this week's caravan approached, Mexico sent soldiers to patrol its southern border and monitored the area with drones. Migrants sometimes travel via caravan because it provides safety in numbers and offers a chance for migrants too poor to pay smugglers. Amid the chaos of the crossing some found a warmer reception. ""We went into a house and the very kind woman told us to stay there, that they (authorities) had no right to enter and she gave us food,"" said Bryan Fernandez of Honduras. He said he didn't know what to do now though. ""If it gets ugly, we don't know which way to go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrant-caravan-crosses-into-mexico-1.5433707,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mexico-us-border-detainees-1.5402767 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/guatemala-migrant-caravan-1.5431161,/news/world/mexico-us-border-detainees-1.5402767 /news/world/guatemala-migrant-caravan-1.5431161
403,Ashley Heisler,2019-12-21T09:00:00.675Z,Canada should be going for gold-standard when protecting elite athletes from abuse,"This column is an opinion by Ashley Heisler, a second-year law student at the University of Ottawa and a former NCCA Division I athlete in women's lacrosse. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. The recent New York Times video featuring U.S. long-distance runner Mary Cain shook the track and field community in North America with a heart-wrenching story of physical and emotional abuse, and it has an all too familiar ring for those in sport in Canada. At 17, Cain signed a professional contract with Nike after becoming the youngest American track-and-field athlete to make a world championship team. Filled with potential, Cain says she was the ""fastest girl in America, until I joined Nike."" The seven-minute video provides an unadulterated recount of Cain's tenure training with Alberto Salazar's now dismantled Nike Oregon Project, during which she lost her period for three years, broke five bones and was burdened by suicidal thoughts. In Oregon, Cain says her male coaches insisted that, to be successful, she needed to be ""thinner, and thinner, and thinner,"" to the point where her body screamed for help. In Canada, physical, psychological, sexual and emotional abuses have had severe and lasting effects on our nation's elite athletes, as well. In a federally funded, anonymous survey consisting of 1,000 former national team athletes this past year, for example, ""13 per cent of current and 20 per cent of retired athletes reported they had experienced suicidal thoughts,"" with only 15 per cent saying they had reported their experiences officially. Sandra Kirby, a professor at the University of Winnipeg and former Olympian who completed a study similar to the federally funded report, found that throughout Canada's elite sports management and coaching environments there is a general disrespect of the fact that athletes are people. In other words, viewing athletes as a tool or mechanism for profit, medal count, or reputation often takes precedence over their safety and well-being. Some are no longer staying silent. This past June, former Canadian Olympic skier Allison Forsyth launched a class-action lawsuit against Alpine Canada, claiming that the organization failed to protect its female athletes from sexual assault by former coach Bertrand Charest. When Forsyth initially reported the incidents to Alpine Canada, she says she was told to consider her allegations as she could be responsible for a loss of team sponsorship, and adds there was an implication that there could be effects on her own professional career. Others in sports in Canada have also gone public with accusations of inappropriate treatment of athletes by coaching staff or failure to properly protect athletes. Instances of ""abuse, manipulation and inappropriate behaviour"" have been alleged against a former coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps soccer team, the Under-20 Women's National Team and assistant coach to the 2008 Canadian Women's Olympic Team, Bob Birarda. Among its conclusions, a report commissioned by the Whitecaps and submitted Dec. 13 found that the club failed to ensure Birarda was adhering to a code of conduct designed to protect players, and made 34 recommendations to improve player safety and complaint management.   Athletes in hockey, bobsleigh and rowing have also been coming forward with allegations of inappropriate treatment and behaviour. While formal litigation is an option and Canadian courts have established that coaches and their team staff owe a general duty of care to their athletes, the case law is limited. Many lawsuits are settled before they can be determined by a judge, leaving no room for binding precedent. The decisions that are published primarily deal with male professional athletes, and often fail to consider the additional barriers and vulnerabilities female athletes face, such as less funding, lower representation and gendered stereotypes. Further, they generally fail to address the psychological repercussions of abuse, even in cases stemming from physical acts. But outside the courts, while new policy protecting both female and male athletes pursuing professional and amateur sports careers in Canada is in its early stages, recent reforms suggest that measures safeguarding athletes are starting to change — and for the better.   Kirsty Duncan, the Minister of Science, Sport and Persons With Disabilities prior to the announcement of the new Liberal cabinet on Nov. 20, launched three major developments in order to combat harassment, abuse and discrimination at all levels of sport. First, an Investigation Unit supported by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) provides members of national sports teams with a third-party avenue to resolve disputes independent of an athlete's sports organization. Second, the Canadian Support Helpline was established as a neutral ""listening and referral service"" for athletes experiencing or witnessing harassment and discrimination in their sport. Third, Duncan committed to enforce a safety-valve mechanism, wherein federal funding will be withheld from national sports organizations if they fail to report incidents of discrimination and harassment, or don't utilize the SDRCC-supported Investigation Unit. For female athletes, specifically, Duncan took further steps towards ensuring their safety by appointing a federal Gender Equity Secretariat responsible for, ""developing, implementing and monitoring a gender equity in sport strategy."" This position is charged with facilitating initiatives to attract and maintain a greater female presence in sport, including athletes, coaches and officials, and aims to create a safer environment in which to train and compete. Members of national sport organizations will also be forced to undergo mandatory training in national policies around anti-harassment, abuse and discrimination before April 2020. It remains to be seen how the government will expand on these initiatives, as rookie MP Steven Guilbeault takes over the sport portfolio as part of his responsibilities as the new Minister of Canadian Heritage. However, the implementation of these early policies by his predecessor suggests an evolution in the culture of Canadian sport that is refusing to let competition harm athletes, and is helping to end silence around abuse. While the process of ensuring that athletes may pursue their goals without fear of abuse or harassment will hardly be linear, its current direction points to a promising future. As Olympic medallist Forsyth puts it, ""There is a strong sense of urgency to take action. We are not seeking perfection; we are seeking progress to ensure a safe, healthy sport environment for all athletes in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-sports-abuse-ashley-heisler-1.5363248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/elite-athletes-abuse-1.5125147 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur-sports-coaches-sexual-offences-minors-1.5006609 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/canadian-athletes-want-the-lip-service-around-safe-sport-to-stop-1.5117345 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/athletes-renewing-call-independent-body-investigate-abuse-1.5378762 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abuse-sport-summit-1.5126753 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/shoemaker-canadian-olympic-committee-safe-sport-1.5128210,/news/canada/hamilton/ohl-racism-bullying-1.5395166 /sports/olympics/winter/bobsleigh/kaillie-humphries-bobsleigh-canada-harassment-todd-hays-1.5283064
404,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-15T17:58:55.890Z,'I did not kill her': Justice officials withheld report signalling no homicide while Alberta man sat in prison,"Butch Chiniquay was only months into a lengthy prison sentence in the death of his girlfriend, Charmaine Wesley, when senior officials in Alberta's Justice Ministry obtained a report that might have exonerated him. An initial autopsy had found that Wesley's 2011 death was a homicide, and that her injuries were ""inflicted trauma."" Chiniquay was charged with second-degree murder. But a later medical report written in November 2012 by a panel of expert pathologists concluded that there was no adequate evidence of homicide and that Wesley's injuries in a car accident were a possible cause of her death. An investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate has found that report, commissioned by Alberta Justice, was never provided to Chiniquay or his lawyer. In a recent interview, The Fifth Estate host Mark Kelley showed Adriano Iovinelli, Chiniquay's lawyer, the previously undisclosed medical finding. ""Why am I seeing this for the first time?"" Iovinelli said. ""You're not going to get [his] period of incarceration back."" Chiniquay, 34, said he feels vindicated by the new revelations. ""I am being honest, and I am telling the truth, and I am innocent,"" he said during an interview at his home on Stoney Nakoda First Nation, 60 kilometres west of Calgary, where he now lives after being released from prison. ""I did not kill her."" These revelations come as part of a six-month The Fifth Estate investigation that found senior officials at Alberta Justice were aware of a report that shook the foundations of several murder charges and cast into doubt numerous findings of a medical examiner in Calgary a decade ago. At issue were some of the autopsies performed by Dr. Evan Matshes, a forensic pathologist working out of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Calgary in 2010 and 2011. After concerns were raised about some of his findings, Alberta Justice launched an inquiry into whether or not there had been miscarriages of justice relating to autopsies. Alberta Justice eventually decided to hire an external review panel of three U.S. forensic pathologists to assess Matshes's work. The panel later stated their opinion that Matshes had made ""unreasonable"" findings in 13 of 14 cases reviewed. Five of those cases were related to criminal charges. Yet The Fifth Estate has learned that in several criminal cases, those findings were not provided to defence lawyers or their clients, and that the report was buried for years by Alberta Justice — even as the incarcerated were serving their sentences. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Iovinelli said that it is up to Alberta Justice to explain why those reports were not released to defence lawyers. ""This is a significant difficulty that has to be addressed by the government, it just has to be,"" Iovinelli said. Alberta Justice declined repeated requests to speak to The Fifth Estate. Eric Tolppanen, the head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement that information was provided to defence lawyers ""where required"" and that they are ""confident"" that they met their ""disclosure obligations."" Tolppanen did not elaborate about what, if any, disclosure was provided or to whom. Legal experts consulted by The Fifth Estate say Alberta Justice was required by law to disclose any relevant documents to defence lawyers. ""It's not a question you have to give any thought to at all,"" said James Lockyer, a lawyer with Innocence Canada and an expert in wrongful convictions cases. ""Alberta Justice has a lot to answer for."" Internal email correspondence shows that Alberta Justice acknowledged it must ""disclose to the defence what we know."" Court records also show that Greg Lepp, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, and now a provincial court judge, acknowledged Alberta Justice had a ""constitutional"" obligation to disclose the results of the expert review to defence lawyers. Alberta Justice also stated the findings of a medical examiner was often ""critical to the outcome of court cases."" ""The deputy (minister) is particularly concerned about whether there is someone in prison,"" Lepp said in a 2012 email to several senior justice officials. Tolppanen said that Chiniquay's lawyer Iovinelli was aware that ""additional disclosure regarding Dr. Matshes was available"" and that Iovinelli told Alberta Justice he did ""not require this further disclosure."" Iovinelli bristled at that suggestion. ""At no time was I ever told that there was a peer review done that indicates that this is not a homicide,"" he said. ""And more importantly, if they had that in their hand, why didn't they do something about it?"" Matshes declined to speak to The Fifth Estate.  ""I stand by my work,"" he wrote in a statement. ""I have devoted my professional life to making sure that the criminal justice system holds those guilty responsible for their crimes and does not prosecute the innocent."" Alberta Justice began looking into Matshes's work in early 2012 after an insurance company raised concerns about one of his accidental death autopsies. Internal records show officials were most concerned about possible wrongful convictions. A panel of three forensic pathologists was selected to review several of Matshes's autopsies, including cases that had already led to second-degree murder charges. One case involved 18-year-old Shelby Herchak, who was described in news headlines as a ""baby killer."" In 2010, she was charged with second-degree murder after her 26-day-old son Daniel died of blunt-force trauma to the head. Herchak later accepted a plea deal for manslaughter and served more than five years in federal prison. The original report by Matshes stated there were multiple injuries to Daniel's head, including one that was seven to 15 days old. To the police, that meant intent. Herchak was charged with second-degree murder. ""That medical examiner deemed me a monster,"" Herchak said in a recent interview at her home in Calgary's south end. No one told Herchak that senior officials in Alberta Justice — including some who are now judges — had initiated that review of Matshes's work. Her son's autopsy was among the cases reviewed. That report could have been critical to Herchak's defence because it questioned two key facts the Crown asserted to the judge ahead of her sentencing. The expert review panel disputed that there was evidence of that earlier injury to Herchak's infant son, Daniel. They also raised concerns that Matshes may have mistaken a natural separation in a newborn's skull, which is not fully fused, with a fracture. The possibility there was a single injury to Daniel's head would have fit Herchak's assertion that she dropped her baby after waking up suddenly. ""I did not kill my son. It was an accident. I dropped him,"" Herchak said. Alberta Justice was provided the new evidence contradicting Matshes's report long before her murder trial was to begin, yet did not disclose it. Lockyer said Alberta Justice has no justification for burying the report, and it was obligated to provide it. ""You have three pathologists who have reviewed the case and reviewed the original autopsy and all three of them are agreed that the original autopsy report was erroneous, wrong,"" Lockyer said. Without that evidence, Herchak told The Fifth Estate she agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in order to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. ""To go through trial on a second-degree murder charge knowing that the medical examiner, all the stuff that he said, the judge and the jury would have believed him over anything that I said,"" Herchak said. ""I just gave up, I couldn't do it anymore, I didn't want to go to jail for life."" In January 2012, Chiniquay also agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter to avoid going to trial on his second-degree murder charge. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Lockyer said the accused's decision to agree to a manslaughter plea bargain is not unusual in the circumstances. ""We know from wrongful conviction cases in Canada … that people pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit because they were facing a murder charge,"" he said. The Fifth Estate showed Herchak a copy of the expert review panel report for the first time — seven years after it was written. ""Who in their name would bury a piece of paper so far down to make sure that nobody saw it, and send someone to jail for 5½ years? And with the name 'baby killer' for the rest of her life,"" Herchak said. In his statement, Matshes told The Fifth Estate he has been the victim of ""personal vendettas"" and ""local politics."" In a series of letters and emails to Alberta Justice in 2012 and 2013, Matshes and his lawyers asked that the findings of the review panel be set aside. Initially, Alberta Justice vigorously defended its process and the findings of the report. Officials with the ministry said they were concerned about possible miscarriages of justice and the impact on murder cases. Then in November 2013, Alberta Justice conceded in court that Matshes was not properly consulted. Both parties agreed to set aside the expert panel report. A judge formally approved the agreement and issued an ""order to quash."" At the same time, Alberta Justice told the court that it was ""integral"" that they continue their probe of Matshes's work. ""The minister also asserts that the administration of justice demands a new external review panel be conducted,"" said Marta Burns, then senior legal counsel and now a superior court judge with Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench. Alberta Justice did not respond to The Fifth Estate's queries about why that second review has not taken place, six years later. ""Nothing has happened,"" said Butch Chiniquay's lawyer Adriano Iovinelli. ""Who dropped the ball?"" In an email, head Crown prosecutor Eric Tolppanen said that because of the decision to ""quash"" the report, the findings are therefore ""inconsequential."" Matshes is now suing Alberta Justice, his former boss in the medical examiner's office and the expert panel members for $30 million for defamation. The Fifth Estate obtained the expert review reports and other related documents from two court actions initiated by Matshes against Alberta Justice. The Fifth Estate asked forensic pathologist Dr. John Butt for his opinion of review panel findings and related court documents. ""What this suggests to me is that there is a significant problem with the work that was done by Dr. Matshes,"" said Butt, who has helped develop medical examiner legislation across Canada. ""My understanding now is that the justice department swept this whole thing under the rug."" Some of the most senior members of Alberta Justice, including the then-ministers, were involved with and co-ordinated the review of potential miscarriages of justice relating to those autopsies. The review of Matshes's work was directly under the purview of Greg Lepp, now a provincial court judge, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service. ""We have a constitutional obligation to disclose anything that affects the case[s] to defence counsel,"" Lepp said in sworn court testimony in 2013. ""And we also have an obligation as prosecution service to consider this situation and determine what steps, if any, we're going to take in relation to these cases."" Reached at his office in Edmonton's provincial court, Lepp said he could not discuss whether disclosure had been provided. ""You're just going to have to pursue those enquiries elsewhere since it's just not advisable, it's not a good course of action for a judge to comment on what happened prior to his appointment,"" Lepp said. He added, ""the [justice] department's responsible for the decisions that were taken years ago."" Marta Burns, the former senior counsel for Alberta Justice and now a judge, declined to respond to questions in a statement sent by her spokesperson. ""In her capacity as litigation counsel with the legal services division, Justice Burns was not charged with making disclosure to defence counsel,"" the statement said. ""Decisions in this regard are made by the Crown Prosecution Service."" Tolppanen, the current head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, did not respond to questions about why the second review panel was never convened — after his ministry said justice required it happen. Doug Schweitzer, the current Alberta justice minister, also declined a recent request for an interview with The Fifth Estate. ""This matter predates the minister's time in office,"" his spokesperson said in an email. While the charge goes back almost a decade, Herchak said she is still living with the consequences of a miscarriage of justice. ""Why would you just shuffle the paperwork deep down and, like, destroy someone's life?"" Herchak said. ""That's my life, right there, that could have changed. But instead, I have this to deal with.""

406,Anonymous,2020-01-15T19:44:44.015Z,This Jeopardy champion just earned the title Greatest of All Time,"Being bold paid off for new Jeopardy mega-champion Ken Jennings, while it didn't for his opponents. Jennings won his third match in the Jeopardy: Greatest of all Time (G.O.A.T.) contest televised on Tuesday, an event that's been a prime-time hit for ABC. He pocketed $1 million US by dispatching James Holzhauer, who won one match, and Brad Rutter, who came up empty. The gamesmanship between the three men considered the most accomplished and best known in the modern history of the show, with longtime Canadian-born Alex Trebek as host, proved entertaining while containing all the tension of a major sporting match. I vow to be the People’s Champ. <a href=""https://t.co/PQUJ0ZKBY9"">pic.twitter.com/PQUJ0ZKBY9</a> Jennings took a strong lead in the first game of Tuesday's match by borrowing a strategy popularized by Holzhauer, twice betting all of his points on a Daily Double and winning. He signalled his intention by imitating Holzhauer's gesture of a poker player pushing all of his chips to the centre of the table. <a href=""https://twitter.com/bradrutter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@bradrutter</a> got some tough breaks in this tourney, but real Jeopardy-heads know him as the guy who beat me in three straight tournament finals. For over a decade, he's really had the only credible claim as the Jeopardy GOAT. In a Final Jeopardy question about Greece, Jennings bet all 32,800 of his points on the clue: ""This area of Greece, home to Pan, is synonymous with a rural paradise; it's a setting for Virgil's shepherd poems the Eclogues.""  He correctly posed the question answer, ""What is Arcadia?"" Holzhauer was leading in the second game of the match, where the Final Jeopardy question asked competitors to identify the non-title character in a Shakespearean tragedy with the most speeches. Jennings correctly answered, ""Who is Iago?"" But he bet none of his points. That left an opening for Holzhauer to take the match if he bet all his points and got it right. He bet all his points, but answered, ""Who is Horatio?"" And thanks to you, the fans, for making <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/JeopardyGOAT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#JeopardyGOAT</a> a smash hit. When they put me back on TV someday, it will be your fault.<br><br>What can I say? <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/JeopardyJames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#JeopardyJames</a> out. <a href=""https://t.co/51LtKbc9TS"">pic.twitter.com/51LtKbc9TS</a> At the end, Hozhauer and Rutter hoisted Jennings on their shoulders in honour. The losers each took home $250,000. It's hard not to imagine they'll play again sometime, given the show's success.

407,Cheryl Deschene,2019-04-24T12:00:00.205Z,My son's addictions killed him. His death shows how our systems need to change,"This piece was originally published on April 24, 2019. Nearly every time Jordan called from jail, the conversation started the same.  ""Hey mom,"" or, ""Howdy partner, what's up?"" ""Nothin Jord, what are you doing?"" ""Awww, just bein' tough."" Now I honour his memory by ""bein' tough"" in my own way and advocating for changes that might have saved his life. Addiction must be addressed as a health issue.  Our systems are ass-backwards.  Jordan was born on October 22, 1987.  He was a happy baby and grew into a stubborn, adventurous little boy.  If trouble wasn't following him, he went looking for it.   He loved animals. He loved being at his grandpa's farm and ""working"" in the shop.  He played hockey and baseball. He had many friends and enthusiastically participated in the shenanigans of boyhood. Now, imagine this: you get a phone call and the person on the other end of the line tells you that your 14 year old son — that same kid — is using crack cocaine.   Fast forward through four years of utter hell on earth.  Anxious days and sleepless nights. Curfews, court dates, police, handcuffs, fights, yelling and destruction. Countless visits to local drug houses to find your child followed by countless visits to youth detention facilities. Watching the light in your child's eyes dimming until all you can see is shame, hopelessness, anger and fear. Jordan was 18 when he went into a gas station and demanded money while holding a small jack knife. He was high, of course.  The attendant told him to get lost. He did, but he needed a ride home so he called a taxi and gave the driver his home address. Since the ""robbery"" was a bust, he didn't have any money, so he punched the driver instead.   Do these sound like the actions of a criminal mastermind to you? Me neither. Jordan was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to three years in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary. It was the beginning of the end. Jordan would go on to serve federal and provincial sentences. All of his crimes were fueled by his addictions. The substance of choice changed from time to time, but the substance use disorder remained intact.  Jordan was released from jail for the last time on May 16, 2015. He died the next day. The last time I saw Jordan alive, he looked me square in the eye and said ""I love you mom,"" he embraced me and kissed me on the lips. Jordan never kissed me on the lips.  He waved to me and I waved back. Jordan wouldn't respond when his brother went up to his room to wake him the next morning. I knew that he was gone the second I saw him.  His eyes were open and cloudy and his body felt cold, clammy and empty.   The cause of death was attributed to a lethal cocktail of substances in his system. Any one of them could have killed him. Jordan was compassionate, kind, smart, well spoken, articulate, adaptable, loving and fiercely loyal.  I was proud of him. He was not defined by his addiction or the choices he made while in the throes of his disease. Individuals don't ""choose"" the disease of addiction any more than they ""choose"" the disease of diabetes.   The mental and physical anguish caused by addiction is compounded by the mistreatment, humiliation and judgements doled out by society at large. All of our systems — health care, judicial, social services, policing, corrections — are broken, disjointed, insufficient and inefficient.   Addicts want their lives back, but for many their situation feels insurmountable.  The crippling stigma attached to addiction makes it hard to reach out for help.   Jordan found himself in an impossible predicament, addicted to crack while still a child. He lacked the insight to see how much he was hurting himself.   A part of me wonders if things could have been different. What if, instead of locking him in a youth detention facility, he was placed in a holistic health care facility that catered to his physical and mental wellness?  We must shift how we think about the disease and those who suffer it. We need to build responsive systems. We need early education and intervention, publicly funded detoxification and treatment facilities with compassionate treatment, safe consumption sites, harm reduction initiatives, life and employment training opportunities and decriminalization of all drugs.   If we continue to make this a moral and criminal matter, we will continue to lose our loved ones to the streets, jail and death.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

408,Anonymous,2020-01-20T03:45:04.897Z,"Prince Harry says he's saddened by move to step back, but wants 'more peaceful life'","Prince Harry said on Sunday it brought him great sadness that he was leaving his royal duties after agreeing with Queen Elizabeth that he and his wife, Meghan, would step down from official roles to seek an independent future. Buckingham Palace and the Queen announced on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer use their ""royal highness"" titles nor receive any public funding as part of a deal to end a crisis the couple sparked by announcing they wanted to reduce their duties and spend more time in Canada. In a speech to the Sentebale charity, a clearly upset Harry said the final outcome was not what he had wanted. ""Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations without public funding. Sadly that wasn't possible,"" the prince, the sixth in line to the throne, said. ""I've accepted this knowing it doesn't change who I am, or how committed I am. But I hope that helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step back from all I have ever known to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life."" Under the arrangement, Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between Canada and Britain, but they will not take part in any future ceremonial events or royal tours. ""It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,"" Harry said. ""I want you to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share not as a Prince, or a Duke, but as Harry, the same person that many of you have watched grow up over the last 35 years but with a clearer perspective,"" he said. ""The U.K. is my home and a place that I love. That will never change."" The couple's plans for independence, announced after a long break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the Royal Family by surprise earlier this month and left the Queen and other senior Windsors hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources. However, in a TV interview aired in October, both had made it clear how they were struggling with the immense media attention. Watch: Did the U.K. press push Harry and Meghan away? Harry said he felt his wife had faced ""bullying"" from some tabloids similar to that faced by his mother Princess Diana who died in a car crash while trying to escape paparazzi photographers. ""I was born into this life and it is a great honour to serve my country and the Queen,"" he said. ""When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing. You've looked out for me for so long but the media is a powerful force and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us."" Buckingham Palace has said the couple would no longer receive public money and that they would repay the cost of refurbishing their cottage in Windsor, which official figures show amounted to 2.4 million pounds ($4 million Cdn). But certain details, such as their future security arrangements or whether the couple could continue to use the ""Sussex Royal"" title for their website and branding, have either not been finalized or publicly revealed. Meghan is currently in Canada with their baby son Archie and Harry is expected to join her soon. The same day, Queen Elizabeth was all smiles as she made her way to church after a momentous announcement that  Harry and Meghan would cut almost all of their ties to the Royal Family in favour of a more private life. She was greeted by royal supporters as she entered the church near her Sandringham House estate with her son Prince Andrew. Elizabeth, 93, has been managing a family crisis caused by Harry and Meghan's wish to spend part of their time in Canada and to completely alter their relationship with the rest of the royals. Andrew, meanwhile, has faced heated questions about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Queen's second son has relinquished royal duties and patronages after being accused by a woman who says she was an Epstein trafficking victim who was forced to sleep with the prince. This is the first time Harry and Meghan have commented on the new course of their lives expected to begin this spring. His father Prince Charles and brother Prince William have been silent so far. In a statement released Saturday evening, the Queen put the best possible face on events by saying: ""I want to thank them for all their dedicated work across this country, the Commonwealth and beyond, and am particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" Harry and Meghan will stop using their Royal Highness titles and will lose all access to public funds when they stop carrying out official functions. The news has been greeted with dismay in the Sandringham area, where the Queen and her family are familiar figures. Royal watcher Rosie Viles, who waited for a glimpse of the Queen, said she wasn't shocked by the decision, but was upset. ""It's very sad that he feels that he's got to stand away from royal duties but he's obviously made that decision and I think part of that might have been to do with his mum, Princess Diana,"" she said. ""I'm sad, but it's his decision at the end of the day and obviously the Queen has sorted it all out."" Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, accused his daughter of ""cheapening"" the Royal Family in part of an interview released Sunday. Markle, who has been estranged from his daughter since her marriage to Harry, told Channel 5 news in a documentary that he believed Meghan, 38, was tossing away ""every girl's dream."" ""It's disappointing because she actually got every girl's dream. Every young girl wants to become a princess and she got that and now she's tossing that away, for, it looks like she's tossing that away for money,"" he said. Watch: What security for Harry and Meghan might look like Meghan is not a princess but has the title Duchess of Sussex. ""They are destroying it, they are cheapening it, they're making it shabby ... They are turning it into a Walmart with a crown of it now. It is something that is ridiculous, they shouldn't be doing this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, said he believed that the whole of Britain would want to wish the very best to Harry and Meghan. ""I think the whole country will want to join in wishing them the very best for the future,"" Johnson told Sky News in Berlin where he is attending a summit on Libya. ""As I said before ... I was sure that the Royal Family, which has been around a very long time, will find a way forward.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/queen-all-smiles-after-harry-meghan-announcement-1.5432694,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harry-meghan-lose-royal-titles-1.5432208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5430765 https://www.cbc.ca/1.5432864 https://gem.cbc.ca/media/the-passionate-eye/season-1/episode-139/38e815a-0122f08eca2,/news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988 /news/world/royal-fascinator-finances-prince-of-wales-canada-day-1.5179006

410,Mike Crawley,2020-01-20T14:00:17.452Z,Why the Ford government isn't stopping teachers' strikes with back-to-work legislation just yet,"More than one million students across Ontario face a day of cancelled school in the coming week because of teachers' strikes, but the government of Premier Doug Ford is not using legislation to stop the walkouts — at least not yet.  Legislating teachers back to work is ""the last step,"" Ford said this week when he took questions from reporters at Queen's Park. ""What we really want to do is get a deal.""  How much labour disruption would it take for the government to legislate an end to the strikes? When I asked Education Minister Stephen Lecce, he said that's not his focus right now, and said negotiated agreements are the ""best option for all the parties.""   What neither Progressive Conservative politician mentioned: imposing back-to-work legislation now would not likely stand up in court. To defend such legislation, the government must persuade a court that its actions have a ""pressing and substantial purpose."" That's the legal test established by the Supreme Court of Canada to justify violating the right to free collective bargaining enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A day of school lost here and there to rotating strikes almost certainly doesn't meet that bar, according to legal experts.  ""There's a difference between a pressing and substantial purpose and an inconvenience to the public,"" said Kevin Banks, director of Queen's University's Centre for Law in the Contemporary Workplace.  ""If the government's reasons [for back-to-work legislation] have to do with inconvenience, then it may well be too early,"" Banks said in an interview. ""If things get to the point where the school year is in jeopardy, I suspect that there's a good chance a court would say, 'Yes, that is a pressing and substantial purpose.'""  This is one of the key reasons why Ontario teachers unions are strategically choosing to hold one-day strikes. They fear a full-blown indefinite walkout would soon prompt the government to reach for the hammer of back-to-work legislation. The unions figure these short, rotating work stoppages are their best bet to dissuade the government from making such a move, or to win a legal battle if it comes to that.  Most recently in post-secondary education, it took weeks of strikes rather than days before previous Ontario governments resorted to legislation.  The 2018 strike at York University lasted two months before Kathleen Wynne's Liberal government introduced a back-to-work bill. It died when Queen's Park was dissolved for the election campaign, then the new Ford government moved to end the strike with its first piece of legislation.  In 2017, a faculty strike closed the province's 24 colleges, cancelling courses for hundreds of thousands of students for five weeks before the Wynne government legislated an end to the dispute. That back-to-work bill might not have withstood a legal challenge had the government brought it in sooner, Minister of Advanced Education Deb Matthews told reporters at the time.  ""You have to have a very, very good rationale, that the academic year [must be] in jeopardy,"" Matthews said, explaining that the Supreme Court set a ""very high bar.""  In the 1990s in Ontario, it typically took about five weeks into an education strike before an arm's-length body called the Education Relations Commission ruled that a labour dispute was putting the school year in jeopardy, giving the government the political go-ahead for back-to-work legislation. Mike Harris's Progressive Conservative government pre-empted that process in 1998, moving to legislate when some 200,000 students in eight boards had been out of class because of labour disputes for just two weeks at the beginning of the school year.   In 1997, the Harris government tried to use the courts to stop a province-wide strike just as it began.  A judge declined to give the province the emergency injunction it sought. A two-week strike ensued, ending when teachers returned to work voluntarily.  If the Ford government eventually chooses back-to-work legislation, it faces another key strategic decision: how to determine the terms of the contract? Does the government impose a contract or send the dispute to binding arbitration?   An arbitrator might give the teachers a contract that exceeds what the government wants to spend, either in a wage increase or class size provisions, issues at the centre of the current round of stalled negotiations.  An imposed contract would itself undoubtedly face a legal challenge.

Oakes is an Indigenous woman from Regina who, along with a few other dedicated members, created a Facebook group called Safe and Sober Rides Regina that offers people rides around the city — even in the extreme cold.  The group was created mid-January when temperatures in Regina dipped down to –34 with a windchill that felt like –42 at times. But that cold temperature didn't stop this group of volunteers from driving people to their destinations. ""We drop them off at Wal-Mart or they they have visits with their kids or counselling services,"" Oakes said. ""Or it could be just as simple as going to 7-Eleven and getting a Slurpee.""  There are four administrators who help drive and moderate the Facebook page, and three men who Oakes calls protectors. The project has become a family affair for Oakes; her husband always goes with her for the trips and two of her daughters have become drivers, too.  She has given rides in exchange for food, clothing, items like diapers or simply gas money. Sometimes getting a thank-you is payment enough, she said. ""It's not like we're getting paid an arm and a leg,"" said Oakes.  Many of the people the group helps are single mothers. Oakes has 10 children, five boys and five girls, and she was once a single mother herself, using the bus to get across the city. She says she identifies with many of the single mothers they help and sometimes when giving rides, she shares her own experiences with them. She feels this is a modern day form of kinship where you share what you have with people who are in need.  Raelynn Gushwa, from White Bear First Nations, has used the Safe and Sober Ride Regina multiple times and she says she feels safe bringing her children with her during her trips to go pick up furniture or groceries, sometimes late at night.  ""They're dependable and reliable and they're friendly people so I know I can call Colleen,"" said Gushwa. ""I can rely on them.""  Gushwa said she has had issues with cab drivers in the past so this is a more comfortable option for her.  ""I've had taxi drivers be very inappropriate towards me ... like sexual innuendos, then hitting on me,"" Gushwa said.   Drivers always have a partner with them and Oakes says the drivers look out for one another, warning each other of passengers that may not have the best intentions.  There have been incidents where people were under the influence of drugs and acted out or weren't respectful. ""When they're under the influence like that, they're not in the right state of mind to function or think and it scares me,"" said Oakes. She said seeing the problems with drugs in Regina can be scary at times but she has hope for the city.  ""We're making our own stand and building that security, and it seems like it's a rippling effect. When we build that security within us and we bring more people in there and it gets bigger and bigger, someday Regina will be a safe place again,"" said Oakes. ""I just want people to remember, like, don't walk by a person that needs help, like, help them up like get back on their feet. That's the way it's supposed to be. Help each other; love one another.""   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/safe-and-sober-drivers-regina-facebook-group-1.5429768,[],/news/canada/saskatoon/electric-cars-regina-cold-batteries-1.5429665 /news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-correctional-centre-smudging-1.5431262 /news/canada/saskatchewan/heather-abbey-repay-creative-saskatchewan-grants-1.5428123
412,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:37:32.284Z,P.E.I. Lung Association targets adults in battle against youth vaping,"The P.E.I. Lung Association has launched a new toolkit to help parents, teachers and coaches talk to young people about vaping. The association, in partnership with the Home and School Federation and Sport P.E.I., has created a toolkit with different modules for teachers, parents and families, and coaches. ""We're trying to work with adult influencers that are in the youths' lives to get this information out to them,"" said Julia Hartley, the association's co-ordinator. Hartley said the P.E.I. organization decided to target adults because Health Canada already has an anti-vaping campaign aimed at youth and because surveys had shown them that many adults have misconceptions about vaping. The toolkit covers what vaping is, why it's popular with youth and how to have a conversation about it with young people. The information was still crafted with children in mind — focus groups this fall in Charlottetown and Stratford with youth ages 12 to 14 showed they wanted to hear personal stories from other youth, which is reflected in the material. ""We were trying to meet the kids where they're at and see the kinds of issues that would resonate with them,"" Hartley said. ""Often children aren't as affected by something that might happen to them in 20 years, but when they see someone else that's their age with an issue ... resulting directly from vaping, then I think that that's something that might connect with them a little better."" Aside from the toolkit, the association is lobbying for P.E.I. to follow in the footsteps of Nova Scotia, which is banning the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and juices as of April 1.  The non-profit group Smoke Free Nova Scotia recently conducted a survey that showed 95 per cent of youth who vape in Nova Scotia said they prefer flavoured juices, and more than 48 per cent said they would quit if flavours were banned. The only types of e-cigarettes and juice that will be available in Nova Scotia after the ban comes into effect are bland and tobacco. Hartley said the association wants the same rules in P.E.I. ""These flavours are created to directly target youth and to get them vaping and ... we completely support a ban on flavouring,"" she said. In November, the P.E.I. Legislature unanimously passed a private member's bill that aims to restrict where vaping products are sold, raises the age limit on e-cigarettes and tobacco from 19 to 21 and restricts the sale of certain flavours. The Canadian Vaping Association has said banning flavoured products may protect youth from purchasing e-cigarettes and other vaping products, but limits options for adults looking to stop smoking cigarettes. The Vaping Industry Trade Association said that vaping is much less harmful than smoking, but also stresses that minors should not have access to vaping products.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/vaping-illness-alberta-first-1.5413065 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5270097/stay-away-from-e-cigarettes-doctor-warns-as-vaping-related-illness-sweeps-the-u-s-1.5270102 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-flavours-youth-campaign-1.5421165 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/juul-canada-flavoured-vaping-pods-1.5426832 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flavoured-e-cigarettes-1.5413871 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tax-hike-makes-it-pricier-to-buy-vape-products-in-b-c-1.5417863 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-oleary-fire-dog-saves-owner-1.5433694 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-outreach-centre-1.5433735,[]
413,Isaac Olson,2020-01-18T01:06:47.140Z,NDG's beloved Coop la Maison Verte is closing its doors for good,"After more than two decades in the heart of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Coop la Maison Verte will close at the end of the month. With debt piling up and the cost of running the store heavily outweighing revenue, members who attended Thursday evening's meeting voted overwhelmingly in favour of closing the co-op, located just east of Melrose Avenue on Sherbrooke Street West. The vote was 41 for, seven against and five abstentions. ""This co-op means a lot to a lot of different people,"" said board member Sheena Swirlz. But nowadays there are a lot of competing franchises and businesses with deeper pockets and support, where the Coop la Maison Verte is run by a small team of co-ordinators and a board of directors.  ""We've been operating under an old model for a really long time and we haven't done the work that needs to be done to kind of look at, analytically, the situation and make the changes required to become a more viable store,"" she said. Several board members have quit in recent years, succumbing to the stress of managing a shop that was falling deeper and deeper into debt while struggling to stock its shelves with products customers want, Swirlz said. Without that stock available, customers were heading elsewhere, she said. The co-op was established in 1998 by a group of seven NDG residents who wanted to defy consumer culture while breathing new life into the neighbourhood — boosting local trade and providing a community hub.  Over the years, it became just that. Members of the co-op paid $10 for a lifetime membership, getting 10 per cent off bulk foods, coffee and detergent.  The shelves are stocked with an array of local wares, crafts and beers as well as ecological products aimed at reducing waste. Meanwhile, there was a coffee shop inside and a sitting area that doubled as a community space for regular meetings and events. Over the years, it has become a social hub and gathering place for neighbours, friends and groups. The co-op has garnered more than 10,000 members and developed strong partnerships with local non-profit organizations, artists and businesses in the region that are equally dedicated to environmental and food issues. In 2010, the co-op bought its building in an effort to keep the dream alive, but the building was riddled with problems and in need of expensive repairs. The board eventually sold it and began paying rent once again. Despite the dedication of its members, staff and volunteers, Coop la Maison Verte has been unable to sustain itself and has accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Now, remaining board members are struggling to sort out how to pay that debt off and who exactly is on the hook for the bill. Ralph Olynyk first visited the co-op about 12 years ago on a whim, tried the coffee ""and I haven't left since."" Beyond the coffee, he said he particularly enjoyed all the community events, activities and social interaction that goes on there as he was introduced to new ideas, initiatives and friends.  He attended the vote, hoping they would be able to find a new way to make the place viable once again.  But he didn't get his wish and, after years of keeping a stool warm at the coffee bar, he's going to have to look for another place to sip java and chat with passersby. ""There's no café around here that attracts me,"" he said. ""In my neighbourhood, there's almost nothing.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/coop-la-maison-verte-closing-ndg-1.5427545,[],/news/canada/montreal/ndg-public-park-planning-1.5062581 /news/canada/montreal/mackay-centre-and-philip-e-layton-schools-inaugurated-in-ndg-1.4838383 /news/canada/montreal/saint-raymond-painting-hydro-poles-1.4934926
414,Anonymous,2020-01-19T10:54:01.438Z,Police fire tear gas to disperse thousands in central Hong Kong,"Police fired tear gas on Sunday to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters who gathered in a central Hong Kong park but later spilled onto the streets, briefly barricading roads and spray-painting buildings. Out in numbers before the demonstration began, police intervened promptly when the rally turned into an impromptu march. Several units of police in riot gear were seen chasing protesters and several arrests were made. A water cannon truck drove on central streets, flanked by an armoured jeep, but was not used. Organizers initially applied for a permit for a march, but police only agreed to a static rally in the park, saying previous marches have turned violent. Once protesters spilled onto the streets, some of them, wearing all-black clothing, barricaded the roads with umbrellas and street furniture, dug up bricks from the pavement and smashed traffic lights. Police said in a statement two police community liaison officers were attacked with wooden sticks and sustained head injuries. They also said some protesters threw water bottles at some other officers who were conducting a 'stop and search' operation. ""In view of the violent incidents, police officers have asked the organizer to halt the public meeting ... and urge participants to ... leave the area by public transport,"" the statement said. The ""Universal Siege Against Communism"" demonstration was the latest in a relentless series of protests against the government since June, when Hong Kongers took to the streets to voice their anger over a now-withdrawn extradition bill. The protests, which have since broadened to include demands for universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police handling of the demonstrations, had lost some of their intensity in recent weeks. In an apparent new tactic, police have been showing up ahead of time in riot gear, with officers conducting ""stop and search"" operations near expected demonstrations. ""Everyone understands that there's a risk of stop-and-search or mass arrests. I appreciate Hong Kong people still come out courageously, despite the risk,"" said organizer Ventus Lau. On Jan 1, a march of tens of thousands of people ended with police firing tear gas to disperse crowds. The gathering in the park was initially relaxed, with many families with children listening to speeches by activists. In one corner, a group of volunteers set up a stand where people could leave messages on red cards for the lunar new year to be sent to those who have been arrested. One read: ""Hong Kongers won't give up. The future belongs to the youth."" Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,000 people, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody. Anger has grown over the months due to perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip over the city, which was handed over to China by Britain in 1997 in an deal that ensured it enjoyed liberties unavailable in the mainland. Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-pro-democracy-march-tear-gas-1.5432472,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-pro-democracy-march-christmas-day-tear-gas-1.5408523 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-uighurs-1.5406158 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-mall-protests-1.5397066,/news/world/hong-kong-protests-uighurs-1.5406158 /news/world/hong-kong-mall-protests-1.5397066 /news/world/hong-kong-carrie-lam-protest-polls-vote-1.5373374
415,Shaina Luck,2020-01-20T20:41:10.789Z,Public to get more time to file formal complaints against police,"The province plans to give people in Nova Scotia more time to file an official complaint against police.  Right now, someone who wants to file a complaint with the independent Office of the Police Complaints Commisioner has six months to do so. The province plans to extend the time limit to one year. The change would apply to all municipal police forces in Nova Scotia. The time limit on complaints against the RCMP is already one year. The current police complaints process has come under fire in the last year in some high-profile instances, such as Carrie Low, a woman who said Halifax Regional Police failed to properly investigate a rape committed against her. The complaints process was also identified as a concern in the Wortley report, which was released by the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission last year and examined street checks by police on the black community. ""I think a year is far more consistent with other policing services across Canada, and a six-month time limit is just ultimately too short,"" said Emma Halpern, the executive director of the Elizabeth Fry Society of Mainland Nova Scotia.  ""It doesn't allow people to process what's happened and their concerns and complaints in order to bring it forward. So I think it's definitely a positive all around to see the complaints process amended."" However, Halpern said for sexual assault survivors, a one-year time limit on complaints may be too short. ""Because of the incredible trauma associated with sexual assault, the time at which you might discover that you've had a mishandling of the case or a harm committed by the policing agency, that might happen at a later date once you've had a chance to process the trauma that you've been going through. Really, that shouldn't be limited to a year.""  Low's complaint against Halifax police was not heard because she filed it outside the six-month time limit. She has launched a court challenge and wants a judge to order the police complaints commissioner to investigate her complaint. The anticipated changes to legislation, however, would not be retroactive and won't help her. ""I'm certainly delighted to see that there is going to be a change made, however I do feel that there does need to be some alternate changes to that,"" Low said. One issue is that a person might not discover police have been negligent until much later. Even if they quickly file a complaint, it may still be too long after the negligence actually occurred. ""For future, people that need to bring complaints against police services, I think it's great, it's a good step in the right direction. But I will be up for a lengthy battle in mine,"" she said. The province told the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities in a letter that the police complaints commissioner will have the ability to extend the timeline beyond one year if there's a good reason to do so, in the public interest. The province hasn't decided exactly what date the change will take effect, but the earliest it could happen is Dec. 19, 2020.  Last May, the Halifax board of police commissioners decided to ask the provincial minister of justice to extend the six-month period for complaints to one year, following concerns brought forward in the Wortley report.   The police complaints commissioner, Judith McPhee, also asked for the six months to be extended. Halifax Regional Police Chief Dan Kinsella told reporters at a board of police commissioners meeting Monday that he was not certain how the proposed change would affect the number of complaints and the cost of responding to them.  ""We will respect any changes that are brought forward,"" he said. ""As far as costing goes, it remains to be seen. Intuitively you would say that there will be an increased cost because there's more of an opportunity for people to bring these matters forward.""  Kinsella said he thinks it is ""exceedingly important"" for people to bring their concerns about police forward.   ""We need to increase the dialogue, we need to increase community members' opportunities to come forward whenever they want to bring any information in regards to police conduct or activity,"" he said.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/public-will-get-more-time-to-file-formal-complaints-against-police-1.5433413,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/police-say-missing-truro-man-was-killed-1.5433206 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/saint-john-man-identified-after-body-found-digby-county-1.5433163 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-nova-scotia-halifax-1.5428347 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/facilities-at-clam-harbour-beach-to-be-torn-down-1.5432945 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/jim-smith-liberal-cabinet-minister-health-community-services-justice-1.5433030,[]
416,Charlene Pele and Frances D'Emilio,2020-01-17T20:52:10.829Z,Portrait found in gallery walls verified as missing Klimt masterpiece,"Art experts have confirmed that a painting discovered hidden inside an Italian art gallery's walls last month is Gustav Klimt's Portrait of a Lady, which was stolen from the gallery nearly 23 years ago. The authentication of the painting announced Friday solved one of the art world's enduring mysteries — where did the missing work end up? — but left several questions unanswered, including who had taken it and whether it ever left the museum's property.  A gardener at the Ricci Oddi modern art gallery in the northern Italian city of Piacenza was clearing away ivy last month and noticed a small panel door on a wall outside. He opened it and, inside the space, found a plastic bag containing a painting that appeared to be the missing masterpiece. ""It's with no small emotion that I can tell you the work is authentic,"" Piacenza prosecutor Ornella Chicca told reporters Friday, as two police officers stood on either side of an easel bearing the recovered painting.  Portrait of a Lady, depicts a young woman sensually glancing over her shoulder against a dreamy, moss green background. Klimt finished the painting in 1917, the year before he died. The Ricci Oddi gallery acquired it in 1925 and reported it missing in February 1997.   Since the gardener's discovery on Dec. 10, the canvas had been kept in a vault of a local branch of Italy's central bank while experts used infrared radiation and other non-invasive techniques to determine if it was the original. Experts said the painting was in remarkably good condition. One of the few signs of damage was a scratch near the edge of the canvas that may have resulted ""from a clumsy effort to remove the portrait from its frame,"" said Anna Selleri, an art restorer from the National Gallery in Bologna, Italy.  The experts who did the verification work found persuasive evidence in the work of their peers more than two decades ago.  An Italian high school student, preparing for her graduation exams in 1996, noticed striking similarities between the painting and an earlier Klimt work of a woman with a similar posture and gaze — but wearing a hat and scarf, accessories that the artist didn't include in Portrait of a Lady.  Intrigued by the observations of the student — who went on to become an art researcher herself — experts back then examined the artwork in the Piacenza gallery's collection and found that Klimt had painted it on top of an earlier portrait of a woman. Experts studying the recovered work in recent weeks, with the aid of X-rays, saw the earlier portrait. Selleri said the radiation analysis revealed that while painting the later portrait, Klimt didn't redo much of the face, but used whitish pigment from the earlier version for the skin. Portrait of a Lady was officially listed as missing on Feb. 22, 1997, but might have been snatched from a gallery wall a few days earlier, during the exhibit preparation work. So who stole the painting? Chicca said police were studying some traces of organic material on the recovered canvas in hopes they might provide leads.  Asked if authorities knew if the piece had ever left the gallery's grounds, investigators said that's something else they hope to find out.  As for why and when the painting ended up stashed behind a wall, journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor, the author of a book about the dramatic fortunes of Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, has an educated theory.  Before the 1990s, Klimt was largely ""considered an Austrian painter, but his stature really grew at this point,"" O'Connor said. When Portrait of a Lady was taken, the value of the art nouveau artist's paintings was ""soaring,"" she said.  O'Connor ventured that perhaps whoever took the painting stowed it behind the gallery's walls while waiting for news about the heist to die down but the stolen work proved ""too hot to handle.""  ""It would have been hard to sell it to a private buyer"" on the so-called grey market, O'Connor noted in a phone interview from London.  Some of Klimt's works have experienced stunning turns of fortune. O'Connor's 2012 book The Lady In Gold chronicled the ultimately successful effort by a woman to recover Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer.  That portrait was snatched from the Bloch-Bauer home in Vienna in 1941 by a Nazi officer. The woman, Bloch-Bauer's niece, later sold the painting to cosmetics mogul Ronald Lauder in 2006 for $135 million US. Another famous Klimt piece is a second portrait of the same woman, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II. Oprah Winfrey eventually purchased that painting and reportedly sold it a few years ago for $150 million.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/painting-verified-klimt-1.5430909,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/stolen-klimt-walls-1.5392094 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/climate-strikes-impeach-o-meter-fixing-democracy-spoofing-downton-abbey-nxivm-whistleblower-more-1.5297400/an-art-dealer-disappeared-with-50m-17-years-later-a-documentary-crew-found-him-1.5297422 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nazi-looted-painting-returns-to-vienna-museum-1.972466,/news/canada/toronto/banksy-art-reported-stolen-1.4706015 /news/entertainment/banksy-bataclan-theft-1.4995347 /news/canada/calgary/gallery-tr%C3%A9panierbaer-stolen-art-painting-mike-bayne-oil-theft-calgary-1.4763062

A cancer in women with textured breast implants is more widespread than previously believed, raising questions for patients and physicians about continuing to describe it as ""rare."" As of Dec. 20, 2019, Health Canada said it had received 106 reports describing ""breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"" including both confirmed and suspected cases. That's double the number of confirmed cases the regulator said it had received before last May.  In 2018, Marketplace went undercover to find out if plastic surgeons were downplaying the risk of breast implants. The common heartburn medication Pepcid is in short supply across Canada, and experts say it's a direct result of the recent international recall of Zantac. Zantac was recalled in the U.S. and Canada in October after a potentially cancer-causing chemical was found at low levels in the drug.

419,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-19T12:00:00.284Z,Mailbox snowed-in again? This community found a fancy fix,"Residents of a New Brunswick community are trying to make a trip to the mail a more pleasant experience.   A group in Keswick Ridge came up with a plan to build a giant shelter for the community mailboxes so residents don't have to fight large piles of snow, strong winds and heavy traffic to get their mail.  ""If you're an old person … with the wind blowing and raining and snowing, it's a good little protection,"" said Earl Gilbey, who designed the shelter himself. People in the community, about 25 kilometres northwest of Fredericton, started working on the project in 2018. The shelter, which resembles a small house, was built for $10,000 and completed in the fall. ""The delivery lady who puts the mail in the boxes, she really loves it,"" said the 72-year-old Gilbey. ""It's better than standing out on the rocky road with 100 km/h gale blowing in your face.""   The shelter sits beside the Keswick Ridge Community Hall on Route  616, a stretch of road notorious for ruts and potholes. It was designed to resemble the local hall. It also has motion detectors that turn on the lights when someone's getting their mail — a feature that most community mailboxes don't have. ""We have the nicest rural community in central New Brunswick and we want to maintain that,"" said Gilbey, who has lived in Keswick Ridge his entire life. Safety and comfort, more than snow, were motivating factors for the Keswick Ridge residents. But for years, people in rural areas across the province have complained about large piles of snow blocking them from accessing their community mailboxes.  Some have said a mountain of snow builds up when a plow comes through and blocks access. Others have said the large snowbanks happen because Canada Post doesn't bother to properly clear the snow from the community mailboxes in the first place. This has prevented some residents from getting their mail over the course of several days.  Canada Post is responsible for the maintenance at community mailbox sites. ""We have been doing so for over 30 years and continue to take this responsibility very seriously,"" Canada Post said in an email. ""We clear the area in front of the mailbox and, should a snowplow pass after we cleaned up the area, we will resend a crew to clear the site again."" There are at least 100 mailboxes at the Keswick Ridge shelter. Users range from young families to seniors. ""It's just to make it safer and easier and better for the residents to pick up their mail,"" he said. In 2015 Canada Post moved toward community mailbox sites from door-to-door and driveway mailbox delivery. Gilbey doesn't use the community mailbox because he still has his own, but he would certainly use it if his delivery service were to end. Community hall members paid for the shelter from a lump sum of money it receives from the province's Department of Environment and Local Government every year. ""We're hoping that's a good addition to the community.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/canada-post-community-mailbox-1.5430578,[],[]

421,"Jacques Poitras, Karissa Donkin",2019-11-04T11:00:12.358Z,2 major Japanese investors cool to NB Power's hydrogen partner,"Two major Japanese renewable-energy investors have so far taken a pass on putting their money into NB Power's hydrogen-power partner. The province's publicly owned utility paid Florida-based Joi Scientific $13 million, hoping for a cut of potential profits from its mysterious technology. But a pair of large-scale potential investors in Japan, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Softbank's Vision Fund, have told Joi they need to see more results before they ante up, according to Joi's CEO in a conference call with investors. On the same call, CEO Traver Kennedy also poured cold water on an apparent proposal to have Joi work with Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems to power the Olympic flame at next summer's 2020 Games in Tokyo. Joi was in talks with Mitsubishi, a major Olympic sponsor, about demonstrating its technology during the event, but ""so far they have not provided us funding or stepped up to make it a reality,"" Kennedy said. The conference call took place when Joi was at what Kennedy called ""an inflection point"" — in the midst of a technological audit of their process, which is supposed to efficiently generate hydrogen energy from seawater. The audit was prompted by the company's realization that it was calculating power incorrectly and that the technology's efficiency was poor. During the call, Kennedy acknowledged results from its new calculations were ""disappointing,"" revealing what he called ""poor system efficiencies."" CBC News obtained a record of the call, which took place between mid-July and the end of August. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas said earlier this year that Joi's secret technology could create hydrogen electricity from seawater — and could actually produce more energy than what it took to power the process. One of the company's patents claimed results as high as 200 per cent.  But a former employee told CBC News that the energy output was only around 20 per cent. Last Friday, Thomas told a committee of MLAs that only one test had been at the 20 per cent level and others had better results, showing ""potential."" But he said confidentiality agreements prevented him from naming those figures. He said the numbers would have to exceed 70 per cent efficiency for the technology to be viable and they're not at that point yet. Thomas told the legislature's Crown corporations committee that several large players in Europe, North America and Asia are working with NB Power to ""scale"" the technology to commercial levels. ""There's a number of players working with us on this now, and some pretty strong players,"" he said, ""so we should be in a position in a few months to determine if we can go forward or not."" He refused to name those players. NB Power paid Joi $13 million for licensing rights to use, market and profit from the technology, hoping it would provide an alternate energy source for its Belledune generating station, which must phase out coal by 2030. So far NB Power has reported no profits from that licensing fee. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, ""told us that once we have a unit built that can demonstrate commercial opportunity, they would be interested in investing,"" Joi CEO Traver Kennedy told investors during the call. ""Until we get there, and we're not there yet, they're not interested in investing. … We need to get the technology to product stage."" Softbank's recent investment of more than $20 billion in WeWork, a shared-workplace company, has been flagged by financial analysts as risky. The company's renewable energy investments have focused on wind and solar power. Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems was still looking at Joi at the time of the conference call and visited the company's Florida offices earlier the same month, but hadn't seen enough to inject much-needed capital into the Florida company. Kennedy told shareholders that Mitsubishi Hitachi signed a memorandum of understanding with Joi in August 2018 but didn't commit to investing. ""Once they complete their diligence, they then will develop a commercial business plan and will decide whether or not to invest in our company."" Mitsubishi is an enthusiastic promoter of hydrogen energy, though its chief technological officer, Akimasa Muyama, warned last year that hydrogen from renewable sources would be the norm only ""in the long term,"" after technical advances brought costs down. Mitsubishi is also a major sponsor of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, and during the summer conference call, Kennedy was asked whether Joi was ""still working towards powering the Olympic flame"" at those games.  ""We remain very interested in this opportunity,"" Kennedy answered. ""Not sure if it's going to be the flame, but MHPS presented the idea of participating in the Tokyo Olympics to do a demonstration along with their partners."" He said Mitsubishi officials ""still have interest in this"" and discussed it when they visited Joi's Florida labs, but did not commit any money to make it happen. Mitsubishi and Softbank have not responded to requests for comment. Kennedy told the conference call that earlier this year, Joi ""decided not to accept new investments"" when it realized there was ""uncertainty"" about its power calculations. The company launched a technical audit over the summer. Preliminary results were discouraging, forcing Joi to return to ""square one,"" a former Joi employee told CBC News. That meant ""just basic research, reading scientific articles and finding out what the best avenue is from there,"" said the former employee, who CBC News is referring to as Alex to protect their identity. According to the conference call, Joi's freeze on investment left the company with only enough cash to operate until the end of August, and the company decided to reopen itself to new investment while acknowledging its lack of a breakthrough. ""We're now seeking new funding based upon our new understanding of the system efficiency, realizing it will have a significant impact on the company's valuation,"" Kennedy said during that call. He said Joi was ""being very open and candid about where we are as a company and where we are in terms of our development of commercial product."" Company officials have refused to grant any interviews with CBC News about the state of the company and its research. Despite other large investors holding off, NB Power continues to spend $20,000 per month operating a laboratory at Joi's Florida headquarters. Thomas called that ""a minimal investment.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-investors-hydrogen-partner-joi-scientific-1.5345389,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-joi-committee-1.5344197 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-technology-update-1.5340245,/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-joi-scientific-two-years-behind-1.5225020 /news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-joi-scientific-risk-iron-plant-emissions-carbon-tax-1.5149763 /news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-nb-power-hydrogen-venture-political-panel-podcast-1.5139248 /news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-nb-joi-scientific-investigations-part-two-1.5133447 /news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-gaetan-thomas-1.5131620 /news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-florida-start-up-1.5037917

424,Marjorie Dowhos,2020-01-17T11:00:00.928Z,'It keeps our language alive': Winnipeg youth choir will sing national anthem in Ojibway at Jets game,"On Friday night, Winnipeg Jets fans will witness a first for the team, as students from Riverbend Community School perform Canada's national anthem in Ojibway. According to the team's website, this will be the first time O Canada has been sung in the Indigenous language at a Jets game. The Riverbend School's Strong Warrior Girls Anishinaabe Singers, a choir made up of 10 singers between the ages of eight and 10, will perform the anthem. ""I feel really proud, very proud of them,"" said Gloria Barker, an Ojibway immersion teacher at Riverbend and one of the choir's instructors.  ""For me, it just touches me knowing that they've come this far, to know the language to be able to sing it proudly at the Jets game,"" she said. ""It's very moving, so inspiring to see the young people speaking their language, and better yet to sing it in their language."" The performance is part of a weekend of Indigenous-themed events for the Jets and the AHL's Manitoba Moose. The teams will host WASAC Night, in recognition of the Winnipeg Aboriginal Sport Achievement Centre, on Friday and the Follow Your Dreams game on Saturday, when the Moose host the Laval Rocket. The teams will be wearing jerseys sporting the special Follow Your Dreams logo. After the games, the jerseys will be auctioned off, with proceeds going to WASAC, which works to create opportunities for Manitoba Indigenous youth to play sports. The weekend events are part of a broader NHL initiative called ""This Is Hockey,"" focused on diversity and inclusiveness. Barker says the Riverbend choir, formed in 2016, has been invited to perform at several other events around Winnipeg. She believes that exposure helped the choir land the gig at the Jets and Tampa Bay Lightning game on Friday. The singers got a little taste of what to expect in front of the home crowd when they performed at a Jan. 10 event at at the Neeginan Centre in Winnipeg, unveiling the special edition jerseys for this weekend's Jets and Moose games. The girls sang two Ojibway songs, Boozhoo (Welcome) and Miigwech (Thank You), to a packed room at the event. Grade 5 student Shaylee Sinclair has been singing with the choir for around two years, and says she's excited to perform on Friday night. ""It's really fun to sing in Ojibway,"" said Sinclair, an Ojibway immersion student at Riverbend Community School. ""You get to learn more songs in Ojibway."" Sinclair says she tries to speak the language at home. Barker says the choir has been squeezing in extra rehearsals since learning earlier this month they would be performing the anthem. ""We have been trying to get them to rehearse every day before they go out for lunch,"" said Barker.  On Thursday, the choir headed to Bell MTS Place for their first rehearsal at ice level. ""It's not fazing them yet,"" Barker said. ""But tomorrow, it's going to hit them."" Barker says what moves her the most is that this experience has transcended all generations. ""The elders were saying that it should be really awesome if we could hear our national anthem sung in our own language. That's really an honour for them,"" she said. ""It's keeping our language alive through revitalization. Reviving our language, giving it back to the younger generation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-jets-choir-ojibwe-o-canada-1.5429759,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/winnipeg-jets-indigenous-logo-jerseys-1.5422902 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/students-southwestern-ontario-singing-o-canada-ojibwe-1.5384227,/sports/hockey/nhl/akim-aliu-nhl-investigation-racism-bill-peters-dec-3-1.5382904 /news/canada/hamilton/ohl-women-hockey-1.5421872 /radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-nov-28-2019-1.5376493/confront-racism-when-you-see-it-in-hockey-says-karl-subban-1.5376522

426,Jorge Barrera,2020-01-21T02:55:09.680Z,Woman denied settlement for sexual assault on way to residential school because she wasn't yet a student,"Therese Keenatch died at 60, two weeks after her residential school compensation claim was first rejected on grounds she wasn't technically a student when she was sexually assaulted by a federal employee on the way to a Saskatchewan residential school. Her daughter, June Keenatch, took up the case after her mother's 2015 death and continued the fight all the way to the B.C. Supreme Court where she faced Justice Canada's lawyers.    Federal lawyers argued that her mother did not qualify for compensation because she hadn't been officially admitted at the school at the time of the assault and the federal employee was also not technically connected to a residential school — though he claimed to take children to the institutions. Justice Brenda Brown sided with Ottawa and dismissed the case in a ruling delivered on Jan. 9. ""I don't think that it was fair; there is no justice,"" said June Keenatch. Keenatch said her mother had six children and used a wheelchair for much of her life.   ""I feel like the government is pretty racist toward First Nations people, like our lives don't really matter,"" said Keenatch, who lives in Saskatoon. NDP MP Charlie Angus said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett, whose department directs Justice Canada on residential school cases, should settle with the family.  Angus said the case was one of the most glaring examples of the legal tactics federal lawyers used to defeat residential school claims.  ""No one in this government has contested in any way the facts of this terrible case. Yet they denied her justice on the grounds she was raped on the way to a residential school and not on the property itself,"" said Angus, in a news conference Monday.  ""What we have seen, time and time again, is a government willing to use the endless resources of the justice department to wage a toxic legal war against the legal rights of survivors."" Therese Keenatch was 15 when she was picked up by a guidance counsellor employed by the department of Indian Affairs while she walked in her home community of Witchekan Lake First Nation in September 1970, according to Brown's ruling. Therese Keenatch ""knew nothing about residential schools . . . and she did not know whose idea it was for her to attend one,"" according to evidence from Keenatch's original testimony described in Brown's ruling. The guidance counsellor then stopped his car near the town of Kilwinning, Sask., and sexually assaulted her before moving on to drop her off at St. Michael's residential school at Duck Lake, about 85 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, according to Keenatch's evidence described in the ruling.  Doug Racine, a Saskatoon lawyer with the Aboriginal Law Group, represented June Keenatch. He said the case was lost on highly technical grounds based on competing interpretations of the wording of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA). ""It is very, very frustrating,"" said Racine, who fought the case for free. ""The courts sometimes are ill-equipped to deal with the trauma and justice in the sense of doing what is right. This was a technical decision."" Therese Keenatch's claim was rejected repeatedly by the Independent Assessment Process (IAP) created by the IRSSA to provide compensation for abuse suffered at the institutions.  The B.C. Supreme Court case hinged on whether the IAP adjudicators erred in their decisions.  Brown said in her ruling that compensation could still be sought from the government through another legal channel. ""This is indeed a troubling case, and a troubling outcome,"" wrote Brown, who is a supervising judge for the IRSSA. ""But as the initial adjudicator noted, the finding that no compensation could be granted under the IAP for this very serious sexual assault in no way precluded pursuing the claim through other means.""  June Keenatch said she is done fighting. ""I just pretty much gave up,"" she said. ""This has been going on for a long time now."" Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett's office said in a statement that what happened to Therese Keenatch was ""horrific and inexcusable."" The statement said the government is committed to resolving all claims, even if they fall outside the negotiated terms of the residential schools settlement agreement. ""Minister Bennett has directed departmental officials to identify other possible means for appropriate resolution as the Government of Canada does not dispute these allegations,"" said the statement. ""Minister Bennett has also directed the department to investigate to ensure appropriate resolution of similar claims."" Angus said the Crown-Indigenous Relations minister should never have fought this case.  ""She needs to come clean with Canadian people. What does reconciliation mean in her government when they take positions like this?"" he said. Angus said the case is just another example of how federal lawyers used technical arguments to defeat residential school cases throughout the settlement process. He said a parliamentary committee needs to review how Ottawa handled the IRSSA. ""We may never know how much of these cases were falsely adjudicated. I think a fair thing, now that this process is coming to an end, would be to learn lessons from it,"" he said. According to the latest statistics available on the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat's website, as of Dec. 31, 2019 a total of 99 per cent of the over 38,000 claims filed have been resolved and close to 90 per cent of IAP claimants have received compensation under the IAP.

427,Andrew Lupton,2020-01-19T09:01:00.235Z,"'Like a gift': after 70 years, Ontario woman discovers half-sister in England","What began as a simple bit of family tree research led Mary Brand of London, Ont., to find a half-sister she didn't know she had in England, the result of a liaison her father had while serving overseas during the Second World War.  And while it's the kind of family secret that could have caused discomfort had it been discovered earlier, Brand and her family couldn't be happier. ""It's like a gift,"" she said. ""It's like a little bit of my father that's come back. I haven't seen him for 56 years and all of a sudden, there's more of him. It's wonderful."" Brand, a 73-year-old retired teacher, opened an Ancestry.com account in 2006 to track down some loose threads in her family history.  She knew of course that her father, bomber captain John Norman (Jack) Harris, had served in the war and played a role in one of its most famous prisoner-of-war camp escapes.  In 1942 Jack Harris's plane was shot down during a raid on Hamburg. He spent the rest of the war at the Luftwaffe-run Stalag Luft III POW camp in Poland. A group of prisoners famously broke out of that camp in 1943 by using a wooden gymnastics vaulting horse to conceal an escape tunnel. Harris was not among the three who escaped. The episode was made into the 1950 movie The Wooden Horse. After the war, Jack Harris returned home to Canada with his wife Aileen Dunkeld who he married in 1942. They had four children together and he began a writing career that would lead to him becoming an acclaimed author. He died in 1964.  Brand knew all this history but what she didn't know is that in 1939, her father had a liaison with a woman in Torquay — a seaside town on the English Channel. It happened while he was there recovering from injuries suffered in a plane crash. Soon after they met he returned to action, likely unaware of the pregnancy. Fast forward to March of last year. After some time away from the website, Brand logged back on to find an unfamiliar face pop up on her computer screen. The website had flagged a woman named Rilba Jones as a possible first cousin to Brand. The website allows users to submit DNA information after providing saliva samples. The database uses that information to identify users' relatives. It didn't take long for Brand to figure out that Jones, who was born in 1940 and six years her senior, wasn't her cousin, but her half sister.  ""Let's just say I looked at the dates and put two and two together,"" she said laughing. A Google search revealed that her half sister is a retired city councillor living in Hull, England.  Mary tried to initiate a conversation over email but Jones didn't respond at first, fearing she was the target of an Internet scam.  Eventually Mary's daughter Alicia made contact with Jones's daughter Harriett. Working together, they discovered this was no scam and that their mothers where half sisters who had been completely unaware of each other's existence for more than 70 years. Shortly after she became pregnant, Rilba Jones's mother married a man named Blair White. He was also a pilot in the war who was killed during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. He died believing that Rilba was his biological daughter. After all, her unusual first name (Rilba) is an anagram of his own (Blair). And while Brand was shocked to learn that she had a half sister, Jones had known for years that her mother had harboured a family secret. Jones made the discovery as a young girl after she was confined in a back room for misbehaving. While serving her punishment, she found an old diary of her mother's at the bottom of a locked trunk (she'd picked the lock). A diary entry revealed details about her mother's first pregnancy.  Rilba confronted her mother. Instead of getting an explanation, she was admonished for snooping and told never to speak of it again. For decades to come, she didn't. She didn't disclose it to anyone in her family, including her husband, until she became a grandmother. After Mary and Rilba connected online last spring, they corresponded and decided to meet in person.  Mary travelled to Hull in October. The two hit it off right away, just like like sisters.  ""We get along really well,"" said Brand. ""I do see a lot of similarities.""  A literary strain certainly runs through both sides of the family.  After the war Jack Harris became a well-known writer who counted among his friends such Canadian literary figures as Pierre Berton, Farley Mowat and Morley Callaghan.  He wrote for many periodicals and his acclaimed mystery novel, The Weird World of Wes Beattie, was published shortly before his death. His book Knights of the Air, about Canadian World War I pilots, was a staple in school libraries.  Mary's only surviving full sibling, John R. Harris, is a speech writer and Rilba's daughter, Harriet, is a journalist. The two half sisters correspond regularly and Mary believes her father never knew his brief affair with Rilba's mother resulted in a pregnancy. Mary Brand's mother Aileen died in 2005 avoiding what would likely have been an uncomfortable revelation, even though the affair that produced Jones happened before they were married. ""It's made it easier that there's no one around to have funny feelings about it,"" said Brand. ""We can all laugh about it and enjoy it and celebrate it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/like-a-gift-after-70-years-ontario-woman-discovers-half-sister-in-england-1.5430710,[],[]
428,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-19T17:02:14.572Z,Public servant who promoted $225M baby formula plant now sits on Chinese investor's board,"The former head of the Canadian Dairy Commission who facilitated a $225-million investment by a Chinese dairy processor to build an infant formula plant in Kingston, Ont., is now serving on that same Chinese corporation's board. In keeping with the ""cooling-off"" period required by federal law, Jacques Laforge waited a year before accepting this paid role. But he was not required to notify the federal ethics commissioner in order to evaluate whether the move was appropriate — something that troubles critics of Canada's current conflict of interest rules. Laforge, a New Brunswick dairy farmer and a former president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada, was appointed CEO of the commission by then-agriculture minister Gerry Ritz in 2012. The director of corporate services for the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), Chantal Paul, confirmed to CBC News that Laforge's mandate ended in May 2018 and he left the Crown corporation at that time. The corporate website for China Feihe Limited says Laforge was appointed as one of its three independent non-executive directors in June 2019. His appointment took effect in October, just over a month before the Canary Islands-registered corporation was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Under Laforge's leadership, the CDC signed agreements in 2016 with Feihe to build a new manufacturing facility in Canada, where no other dairy processor makes infant formula. Now incorporated in Canada under the name Canada Royal Milk, the factory took its first deliveries of Ontario milk in December and currently is testing its processing line. Once production ramps up, most of the formula will be exported to China. Documents obtained by CBC News under the Access to Information Act show that during Laforge's final two years as CEO, the CDC set up meetings for Feihe executives with other levels of government and federal regulators. Laforge also travelled to China multiple times, meeting with Feihe's chairman Leng Youbin and Chinese government officials. ""I definitely was involved in bringing them to Canada,"" he told CBC News. ""We spent a lot of energy ... We opened up the doors for them."" Laforge said he does not believe his role as one of three rotating independent board members amounts to a conflict with his former role at a Crown corporation because it's ""99 per cent international"" and won't deal directly with the Canadian factory. Despite his direct dealings with Feihe as a public official, Laforge told CBC he did not clear his new job with the federal ethics commissioner. When asked what post-employment rules apply for Laforge, the CDC's Paul suggested the CBC examine Section 33 of the Conflict of Interest Act. It says: ""No former public office holder shall act in such a manner as to take improper advantage of his or her previous public office."" A spokesperson for Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion said his office can't answer questions about individuals because of confidentiality rules, but confirmed that Laforge's one-year ""cooling-off period"" is over, so his board appointment is no longer prohibited. Guy Giorno, a former chief of staff to Stephen Harper who now advises clients on ethics and accountability in his legal practice, said not requiring a former senior civil servant like Laforge to disclose offers of employment and submit to an ethics review amounts to a ""hole"" in the law. ""It ought to be mandatory, and it stands to reason that the commissioner can't do a very good job policing people who have left when he's not under the statute required to be told about everybody who is seeking a new position,"" Giorno said. Nevertheless, several federal ethics rules apply for life, Giorno said. Laforge can't give advice based on confidential information he knew as head of the CDC, and he can't ""switch sides"" and start working for Feihe on any financial transactions or legal proceedings he handled at the Crown corporation. But Section 33, the rule against ""taking improper advantage of a previous office,"" hasn't been interpreted very often. Giorno called it ""very fuzzy."" ""That doesn't mean it's unimportant as a general rule ... In fact, it's the first listed in the statute,"" he said. Government service brings with it a network of contacts, goodwill and other ""intangible things"" which taxpayers paid Laforge to acquire, Giorno said. ""My own personal view is that Parliament intended to police the profiting from the monetization of those things,"" he said. ""Nothing happens for nothing. A former public servant must always be asking, 'Why are they paying me?'"" Laforge said he received a number of requests after he left the CDC. He followed its internal policy and waited a year before saying yes to anything, including Feihe's offer last summer. ""It's my first time doing this. I didn't know too much about independent directors,"" he said. ""Common sense was telling me, stay away for a year, and when you start taking things make sure that it's not in conflict of interest with some files."" ""They might have a Chinese name but ... they want to source and do things internationally,"" he added. ""I'm there to observe that they don't make any boo-boos affecting the shareholders."" He said he hasn't been paid yet, but expects his compensation to follow the guidelines of the Hong Kong exchange, which provide for a ""basic fee of at least $400,000 HK ($67,000 Cdn) per year, coupled with additional payments for membership or chairing of board committees."" Laforge sits on two committees, including Feihe's audit committee. ""It might look lucrative,"" he said, adding it's not clear how much time it will require. He also admits he's nervous about the potential consequences of taking on this role. ""I know Feihe's a good company, but companies are companies. They go sideways once in a while,"" he said. David Mulroney, Canada's ambassador to China from 2009-12, said it's not necessarily bad for a company that wants to build a high-quality reputation to have a Canadian aboard. During China's 2008 tainted baby formula scandal, which involved Feihe's competitor, directors on that company's board from New Zealand helped bring the facts to light. While Laforge said his role with the company is largely international, Mulroney said the rationale for his appointment still needs to be explored and explained. And although Laforge's appointment respects the ""cooling-off"" period in the law, Mulroney said that year-long period is too short — and Canadians should expect public servants to do more than tick the box on the minimum post-employment requirements. ""There's something wrong with the speed with which elected officials and senior officials are taking jobs that do suggest they're trading on their past experience,"" the ex-ambassador said. ""The Chinese may be on the lookout for guanxi opportunities in Canada,"" Mulroney said, using a term that means ""connectedness"" to refer to the Chinese approach to networking through seeking out personal connections. Without singling out Feihe, Mulroney said that China's corporate sector writ large is widely seen as too closely linked to the Chinese government. ""It's ... increasingly unclear in Xi Jinping's China that there are companies at all separate from the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said. ""It's difficult to understand why so many high-profile Canadians are allowing themselves to be associated with Chinese firms. It normalizes China at a time when China is anything but normal."" Feihe representatives have not responded to multiple interview requests in recent months. CBC News asked Laforge about his decision to accept this work at a delicate time in Canada–Chinese relations. ""Believe me ... don't think that's not crossing my mind,"" he said. ""It's too late now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/laforge-cdc-feihe-board-appointment-1.5375209,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-plant-kingston-construction-1.4228501 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-plant-trade-1.4228502 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-ratification-canada-friday-1.5429181 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-future-usmca-1.4858338,/news/politics/nafta-ratification-canada-friday-1.5429181 /news/politics/feihe-plant-kingston-construction-1.4228501 /news/politics/feihe-plant-trade-1.4228502 /news/politics/feihe-future-usmca-1.4858338

Parasite, the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreign language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26-year-history of the SAG awards. Parasite lead actor Song Kang Ho said winning on Sunday made him think that ""maybe we haven't created such a bad movie. ""I am so honoured to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,"" he said through an interpreter. Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood movies The Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, which both have A-list stars. The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors  form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Phoenix's terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in Joker has swept awards season. ""I am standing on the shoulders of my favourite actor — Heath Ledger,"" Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor  who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the  comic book villain. Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic Judy. Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role  as a charming stunt man in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama Marriage Story. ""It was a difficult part,"" quipped Pitt of his role. ""A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,"" he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob. Sexual harassment drama Bombshell went into Sunday's awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed. Martin Scorsese's $170 million Netflix gangster movie The Irishman had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on  Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG. Those left out include immersive World War One film 1917,  the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as  well as Joker, Marriage Story, and novel adaptation Little  Women. De Niro, whose lead performance in The Irishman has been  snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech  to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump. In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her  role as a TV anchor in The Morning Show, bringing the second  award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming  service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week. Comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and British royal drama The Crown took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But Mrs Maisel actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should  have gone to quirky British comedy Fleabag. Moments earlier, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a  year of multiple awards for her and the show.

431,Jackie McKay,2020-01-19T15:27:49.728Z,Inuit designers launch new line of parkas for Canada Goose ,"Canada Goose has launched a new collection of Inuit-made parkas.  The collection called Atigi 2.0 has 90 parkas made by 18 seamstresses who all live in Inuit Nunangat — Inuit regions of N.W.T., Nunavut, Quebec to Newfoundland and Labrador. Last year, Canada Goose launched project Atigi with 14 original parkas. The parkas from Atigi 2.0 were shown publicly for the first time at a media launch in New York Thursday.  ""It's unbelievable,"" said Stephanie Pitseolak, one of the designers who lives in Iqaluit. ""I can't believe my parka is there right now.""  New York isn't the only international city her parka will be on display; next week it will be making its way to France where the collection will be on display at the Canada Goose store in Paris. Pitseolak said the experience was exhausting. Canada Goose sends the seamstresses a box of materials to use for their designs. Things like fur, hollow fill insulation, zippers and Canada Goose commanders and patches with the logo. They had a month to make five identical parkas each in a different size.  Even Pitseolak was struggling. She said she couldn't give up and felt like her late grandmother was guiding her while she sewed.  ""I wanted people to know it's possible, even if you're very busy, even if you have kids, even if you're working,"" said Pitseolak.  ""I'm glad I did it and I'm happy for myself.""  The parkas will be on sale at the Canada Goose website for $2,500 each. The proceeds will go to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), a national organization that advocates for the rights and interests of Inuit in Canada.   Canada Goose donated nearly $80,000 to ITK from the sales of last year's Atigi parkas, according to ITK. Inuit land claims organizations for the four Inuit regions — Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Makivik Corporation, and Nunatsiavut Government each received $20,000.   ""We have big plans and a big vision from project Atigi,"" said Gavin Thompson, vice-president of corporate citizenship for Canada Goose. ""We are literally just getting started.""  Thompson said they want to grow the project but wouldn't reveal details of what that looks like.  ""We are just so proud of this collection,"" said Thompson.

432,Michael Spratt,2019-12-13T20:35:59.447Z,'Smarter and stronger'? New law is really a cruel gutting of access to justice for the impoverished,"This column is an opinion by Michael Spratt, a partner at the Ottawa criminal law firm Abergel Goldstein & Partners, former vice-president of the Ottawa Defence Counsel Association, former Criminal Lawyers' Association Board member, and co-host of the legal and political podcast The Docket. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. It appears that Ontario's Attorney General, Doug Downey, is a quick learner. The old saying isn't true, an old dog can learn new tricks. After a rocky summer where Downey took political heat for slashing legal aid funding and publicly musing about messing with Ontario's judicial appointment process so he could more easily pick judges who reflect his values, Downey has finally learned to stop being so transparent. It's a play right out of the Doug Ford handbook — don't listen to the half-truths he says, instead take a close look at what he actually does. You see, Downey was all smiles this week when he introduced his signature justice legislation, the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act, billing it as a fix for Ontario's complex and outdated justice system. He said it would improve legal aid services and enhance access to justice. Downey also announced that following this year's $133 million legal aid cuts, the government has decided not to pursue further funding reductions. It all sounded like a breath of fresh air. But the devil is in the details. It's true that Ontario's court system is in desperate need of modernization. In a damning report, Ontario Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk described a justice system that is outdated and inefficient. She found that Ontario's jails have never been more crowded with people waiting for trials, yet our courtrooms are only used an average of 2.8 hours per day. Delays plague the system, and despite spending more money on Crown Attorneys, cases are taking about 10 per cent longer to complete than they did four years ago. And unlike other jurisdictions, our court system is stuck in the 1970s. In 2018-19, almost 2.5 million documents were filed in Ontario's courts – more than 96 per cent of them on paper. The utter failure of the double Ds – Doug Ford and Doug Downey – on the justice front has resulted in court delays, wasted money, and decreased access to justice. So, back to Downey's new legislation. Contrary to Downey's claims, it is devoid of any meaningful measures to move Ontario's justice system into the 21st Century. Under Downey's rule, the fax machine is still king of the courtroom. But even more duplicitously, despite walking back $30 million in planned cuts to Legal Aid Ontario (LAO), Downey's legislation is a Trojan horse for his ultimate goal – a cruel gutting of access to justice for the impoverished. You see, the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act fundamentally changes the purpose of the legal aid system. Downey's new law literally replaces LAO's current goal, providing high-quality legal aid services to low-income individuals, with a new goal of ensuring value for money. The new legislation also allows the government to more easily stack LAO's board of directors with hand-picked appointments. And if we have learned one thing about the Ford government, it's that it loves unqualified patronage appointments. Most insidiously, buried deep in Downey's legislation is the downloading of millions of dollars of costs, currently borne by the government, directly onto LAO's shoulders. There are a number of circumstances right now that allow a court to order the government to pay legal costs to victims, to youths, to amicus curiae, or to those denied legal aid but in need of a lawyer to ensure fair trial. And these appointments are happening more frequently as LAO tightens its belt and denies assistance to more and more people. The Ministry of the Attorney General used to pay these costs when it was ordered to do so by a court. But not after Downey's new bill. Much like Trump wanting Mexico to pay for his ill-conceived border wall, Downey's legislation says that, ""Despite any order of a court requiring that the cost of providing services … be borne by the Attorney General of Ontario or the Crown in right of Ontario, the cost of providing the services shall be borne by [LAO]."" [Editor's Note: After this column was published, the Ministry of the Attorney General contacted CBC News and said that notwithstanding the wording of the Act, ""The government will continue to cover the costs of court-appointed counsel at the legal aid rate. The Ministry of the Attorney General has provided Legal Aid Ontario with assurances that the funding protocol which has been in place between the Ministry and LAO since 2007 will continue, whereby LAO oversees the logistics and administration of payment to counsel continues and the government continues to cover the costs.""] The impact of this constitutionally dubious immunity clause would allow the downloading of millions of dollars in additional costs, probably more than the cost of the abandoned legal aid funding cuts, onto the backs of the very organization tasked with assisting Ontario's poor and marginalized populations. And as Legal Aid Ontario pays more of these shifted costs, it would have less money to help impoverished accused … which would lead to more court-ordered costs and even less money to help the poor. It's a destructive feedback loop that would crush Ontario's legal aid system. Downey says his new bill will modernize the courts, but it won't. He says his new bill will increase access to justice, but it won't. He says his new bill will strengthen legal aid, but it won't. In fact, Downey has actually done the opposite. He did it quietly and covertly. And he proved that Doug Ford's dog can learn new tricks.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-smarter-stronger-justice-act-legal-aid-1.5393810,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/legal-aid-doug-ford-ontario-budget-1.5389579 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/legal-aid-1.5169428,/news/canada/toronto/legal-aid-doug-ford-ontario-budget-1.5389579 /news/opinion/legal-aid-1.5169428
433,"Alex Migdal, Ben Nelms",2020-01-19T15:00:20.111Z,Here's how people in Vancouver dressed for an unseasonably cold and snowy week,"A knee-length, fur-lined hooded parka was the last thing Maria Alonso expected she would need for her trip to Vancouver in January. But as the flakes fell and the mercury plummeted below freezing earlier this week, the tourist from São Paulo, Brazil took stock of her suitcase and was left with no choice. ""I brought from Brazil some coats, but they aren't enough for this kind of cold,"" she said in Gastown on Tuesday, her breath visible as the temperature hovered around -5 C. The winter bite also meant a scarf, matching hat, thick white gloves and waterproof boots with secure grip.  Alonso wasn't the only one sporting a look typically reserved for the Prairies. The unseasonably cold weather knocked off course the Vancouver esthetic of Gore-Tex, puffer vests and rain boots, forcing many to re-imagine their wardrobes for a few fleeting days. How did they fare? Here's how some explained their sartorial choices. Ignacio Adriasola, an art history professor at UBC, said layers such as long t-shirts help him stay warm.  But the key to staying stylish in the cold, he said, is hiding those layers, which in his case meant adding an elegant overcoat, scarf and hat. ""You don't wear the Patagonia outside,"" he quipped. Zbigniew and Ewa Kupczynski were living in the snowy Nordic city of Stockholm before they moved to Vancouver in 1971. ""The Canadian consul general promised it never snows in Vancouver. It snows every year,"" Ewa laughed. Ewa joked that her husband, a celebrated painter, only wears a warm enough jacket when she tells him to. ""If I say yes,"" Zbigniew chimed in. Victor Davis, 23, was on hour six of his shift delivering food for Door Dash, which involves cycling around the city. ""You get hot and then you get cold,"" Davis said, noting he had five layers on, plus two pairs of socks. What about a layer under his jeans? ""Not today,"" he said. ""I didn't do my laundry."" Charles Guan seemed effortlessly stylish in his all-black ensemble, but he noted it was a blend of casual wear. He switches up jackets but always keeps a thin insulating jacket underneath, plus several layers. ""For cold weather, it's definitely comfort,"" he said. ""I just want to stay warm.""  Olivia Stevens, 18, was more than ready for the winter, having just moved to Vancouver from Nova Scotia. ""My key thing is good shoes because if my feet are cold, I'm cold,"" she said. Stevens considers her whole outfit when dressing up, tying the colour of her jacket to her shoes, under layer and even the font on her hoodie. ""I'm always looking for cool things in thrift shops, pieces that will match. It's a complete look."" It's considered by some the Holy Grail of winter jackets — the Canada Goose parka — and it can run upwards of $1,000. But Candice Ward, who was visiting from Calgary, said she can't live without it. ""I'm warm in really cold weather and I'm still quite comfortable at plus five [degrees],"" she said. ""I'm really struggling,"" admitted Marie-Adeline Sekula, who has lived in Vancouver for six years and often travels back to her native France. Sekula said she typically wears dresses and skirts, but the cold weather forced her to don jeans on Friday, which she paired with a characteristically French beret. Her one saving grace: waterproof Chelsea-style boots, she said.  Sekula paused to consider the frigid weather. ""This isn't going to last, right?"" she said with a nervous laugh.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/winter-fashion-vancouver-1.5432356,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wintry-conditions-continue-to-plague-b-c-after-week-of-extreme-cold-snow-1.5432116 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/snowy-sidewalks-salt-vancouver-1.5428785 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-snow-storm-2020-1.5428324,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/summer-winter-m-s-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-tires-when-it-snows-1.5432005 /news/canada/british-columbia/escooters-pilot-project-1.5431946 /news/canada/british-columbia/no-phone-bill-telus-5000-1.5428591

Quebec Superior Court Justice Serge Gaudet ruled Monday Applebaum is entitled to the money because new rules prohibiting payments to elected officials convicted of crimes went into effect after he resigned. Applebaum, who was first elected to council in 1994, became the city's interim mayor in 2012 but was forced to resign the following year when he was arrested on corruption charges. In 2016 and again in 2018, the provincial law governing severance packages for municipal politicians was modified to exclude politicians convicted of certain crimes from receiving any public money when they leave office. The city sued Applebaum to get its money back, but Gaudet said the law was not made retroactive, and therefore the city's former mayor is not required to return the money. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante told reporters she is disappointed with the ruling and has asked the city's lawyers what other recourse is available to recoup the money. Applebaum was found guilty in January 2017 of eight corruption-related offences related to his time as borough mayor of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, including fraud on the government and breach of trust. Both those offences are punishable by prison terms of up to five years.

""Someone helped me [get] out, but when I wanted to go back in, there was no one to open the door,"" said Marzo, 46.  ""It was cold. I called my sister but my sister was at work … so I waited until my caregiver arrived."" She says none of the other doors in the building is an option. ""That means I get stuck behind the doors. If there's an emergency … if there's a fire, I'm dead, there's no way I can get outside."" According to an advocate for people with disabilities, situations like Marzo's are ""all too common,"" because weak building codes and a lack of provincial accessibility laws are causing a ""chronic and pervasive shortage"" of accessible housing. ""Imagine that you're in a building where you paid good money to live … and you can't get in or out without having someone there,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. ""Imagine you go to sleep at night knowing — God forbid — if there's a fire, you can't let yourself out. No one would want to live that way and people with disabilities shouldn't have to live that way."" Two years ago, after having emergency abdominal surgery, Marzo contracted sepsis — a reaction to a severe blood infection that leads to organs shutting down. Doctors amputated both legs and arms to save her life. Earlier this year, she started shopping for a condo that would allow her to get around with her wheelchair or prosthetics. She says she knew the place she bought wasn't perfect, but it was one of the few she could afford. She hoped to deal with issues as they came up, but never expected to be fighting for a door.  In May, a few months after she was locked outside in the cold, she asked the building manager if automatic doors could be installed. She was told the condo board decided not at this time. Marzo's social worker tried again, contacting the board on her behalf. She was told the board already had a plan for new doors but there would be no automatic push-button system due to security concerns of the doors being open too long. That explanation is ""a total red herring,"" according to Lepofsky. ""You could design doors with optical sensors to protect against that. But even a manual door, with a lock, there's no guarantee that requires it to be held open only long enough for the person with the key to get through."" Meanwhile, Marzo remains homebound and frustrated. ""I don't want to only benefit me. I want people who have lesser mobility to benefit as well. Because it's not easy to just be staying at home and be depressed,"" she said. The property management company declined to answer Go Public's questions, claiming it was a legal matter and referring us to the condo board. Go Public made repeated requests to board members for comment; all went unanswered. Automatic doors would cost between $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the design, according to Sean Crump from Universal Access, a Calgary company that provides advice to businesses on how to make buildings more accessible. Crump says there is public funding available to qualified candidates to help pay for building modifications, though it's not clear if Marzo's building qualifies.  ""There are a few resources. The federal government has an Enabling Access Fund that allows funds to be put into accessible design for spaces and buildings — and it's done a lot of good.""  More than three million people over the age of 15 have at least one physical disability according to the most recent Statistics Canada numbers from 2017. On July 11, the Accessible Canada Act came into force. Lepofsky says it's a well intentioned effort at mandating barrier-free access, but it, too, falls short by covering only sectors within Ottawa's jurisdiction like banking, telecommunications and the federal government. He says that leaves a mish-mash of accessibility laws — or none at all — at the provincial level. Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia are the only provinces with that kind of legislation. ""We need the seven provinces in Canada that don't have a provincial accessibility law to enact one — to get with the program,"" Lepofsky said. But even in those provinces, Marzo would have little or no recourse. Manitoba and Nova Scotia's legislation don't address the responsibilities of condo boards. Ontario's does, but since it was implemented in 2005, it's done little to help people with disabilities, according to a review released in January by former lieutenant governor David Onley. ""We are almost 14 years later,"" Onley, who was Canada's first lieutenant governor with a physical disability, wrote, ""and the promised accessible Ontario is nowhere in sight."" ""For most disabled persons, Ontario is not a place of opportunity but one of countless, dispiriting, soul-crushing barriers."" Changing the building codes could also help, according to Lepofsky. But, though national and provincial codes cover new buildings and major renovations, older buildings like Marzo's are under no obligation to renovate. All of this, Lepofsky says, leaves people with disabilities to deal with problems ""one battle at a time"" through human rights complaints. The national and provincial human rights codes say buildings used by the public need to be accessible.  Marzo says everywhere she turned no one could — or would — help. She says her call to the Alberta Human Rights Commission wasn't returned and the City of Calgary told her there is nothing it can do. ""They just keep [telling me] call this person or this person and eventually someone from City of Calgary called me and said they cannot force the condo board to put the door in because it's not the law."" Go Public took Marzo's situation to provincial and federal lawmakers. Watch: Verna Marzo says she's determined not to let any barriers stand in her way Jennifer Dagsvik, spokesperson for Alberta's Ministry of Community and Social Service, says the province is ""monitoring"" the new federal and existing provincial laws.  She says while Alberta lacks an accessibility law, people with disabilities can seek help under the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Premier's Council on the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Ottawa's most recent minister of public services and procurement and accessibility didn't answer Go Public's questions directly. Instead Carla Qualtrough sent a general statement, referring to the Accessible Canada Act and the accessibility review board — the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO) — it created.  ""While CASDO is still in its early stages of development, it has been made evident by Canadians and members of the disability community that standards in new and existing buildings is a priority,"" Qualtrough said.  Marzo says she won't give up, saying it's ""hideous"" she's had to fight this hard to be able to enter and exit the building she lives in.  She's planning to talk to a lawyer for advice on what to do next. ""They will get old too,"" she says, referring to members of her condo board. ""And they will lose their strength. And they will thank me for that door if they will do it now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/go-public-disabled-automatic-door-1.5313633,[],/news/canada/british-columbia/amputee-claims-discrimination-after-airport-security-takes-batteries-1.5109369 /news/canada/edmonton/disabled-woman-banned-from-no-frills-1.5028056 /news/politics/accessibility-act-duncan-1.4715491 /news/opinion/accessibility-law-1.5005005
436,Vassy Kapelos,2020-01-19T12:00:00.340Z,"As cabinet meets in Winnipeg, Trudeau government's agenda remains unclear","This article is part of CBC News' Minority Report newsletter, which is your weekly tip-sheet to help you navigate the parliamentary waters of a minority government. Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. It's been three months since the election. Can you believe that? I can't. It feels like just yesterday we were talking about increasing regional tensions and whether Andrew Scheer should resign as Conservative leader.  Events, as I wrote last week, change a lot. The devastating shooting down of a passenger jet carrying 57 Canadians - and, as we learned Friday, 29 permanent residents of Canada - has rightly consumed the government.  And yet, there hasn't been a lot of criticism of the Liberal government's response to this file. There is, more largely, a critique from the Conservatives on the Liberal government's general foreign policy towards Iran, which the Tories say is too tender, but on the handling of the crash itself, all of our Power Panelists, of all party stripes - even the few Conservatives who still talk to the CBC, lol - were united this week; the prime minister has struck the right tone.  But Justin Trudeau's attention will now have to turn elsewhere, to a degree. Cabinet is, as you read this, meeting in Winnipeg for the first time this year, and of course, for the first time since the downing of that jet. And beyond responding to this awful tragedy, there will be questions from reporters, that are aimed at trying to figure out what this government will be about. There have been only a few clues so far. The government's throne speech (which happened just six weeks ago - but doesn't it feel like at least year?) echoed much of what we heard during the election: a focus on climate, on reconciliation and a tax cut. We know what the tax cut looks like, but not a whole lot about the rest. The one piece of legislation we can be sure is on the way, is the amendment to Canada's medically assisted dying law. The law was found to be, in part, unconstitutional by a Quebec judge last year. The courts in that province gave the federal government six months to fix the law. The six months will be up in early March and the government has telegraphed that it will likely meet that deadline with a change to the law that will ease the requirement that a person's death must be ""reasonably foreseeable"" in order for them to qualify for an assisted death. But I've been racking my brain (I mean granted it's full of other things too; like, should I buy a snowblower, but still...) because aside from the assisted dying, and the the CUSMA implementation bill, I can't think of another specific piece of legislation we know is coming. And when I talk to people in government, and I ask them what might be coming, I don't get a lot of detail  -- which wouldn't have been the case, say, in 2015. Will the government, for example, introduce legislation to hold itself accountable on its climate targets? Speaking of emission reduction targets, when will the government release its full plan for reaching them, and when or how will it fulfil its promise to be more aggressive on those targets?  On regional tensions, which consumed us after the election and appear to dominate Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's time these days, what will come of her listening tour and multiple meetings with political leaders in Alberta and Saskatchewan? Alberta wants $2 billion in back payments for its struggling economy. Will they get a decision on that big ask before the budget, or will the answer come with the budget? It remains unclear.  Speaking of the budget, when's that coming? My contacts say it won't be an early one, possibly even as late as April. That's important because the budget will likely provide a specific indication, and measure, of the government's priorities.  It's not surprising that it might not happen until spring, there is a lot of frustration among even political staffers about the pace of change in government right now. The prime minister's chief of staff only announced the senior leadership team last week. Communication teams are just now falling into place, but I've had multiple people in those offices tell me it was a painful process; decisions were slow and many loyal staffers felt left in limbo for longer than usual. You can feel that hesitancy in the way some ministers communicate on their files, hedging specifics on plans with the caveat they will need support from, and to consult with, the opposition.  Now, It's a fact to be sure - that in a minority Parliament, the government does need the opposition's support. But will that fact create an overly cautious government agenda? It seems that way right now, but we should have a better idea with this cabinet retreat -- and then most definitely when Parliament resumes in a week. This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter. In this week's issue, Éric Grenier looks at the last time Peter MacKay was leader of a conservative party and what that means for his pitch to replace Andrew Scheer.

437,Kelly Crowe,2020-01-17T09:00:00.025Z,"Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study reveals","A new study published this week tells a darker story about one of Canada's key scientific discoveries — the development of the world's first approved Ebola vaccine. Dalhousie University law professor Matthew Herder used Canada's Access to Information Act to obtain hundreds of documents to track the development of the vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) from the first experiments at Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory in the early 2000s through to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014. The documents reveal Canadian government scientists struggling against federal funding cuts and industry indifference to push the discovery forward.  After spending five years piecing the story together, Herder said Canada's Ebola vaccine experience challenges the dogma that drug companies are the only way to commercialize academic drug discoveries.  Herder's analysis suggests that Canada's scientists did most of the technical development work — even generating hundreds of doses of manufactured vaccine — while the private sector allowed the discovery to languish. In the paper, published in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences, Herder concludes ""the private sector was not only unnecessary to its development, but also likely slowed it down."" ""We have this dogmatic reliance upon the private sector,"" Herder said. ""That is not always warranted. Our case study of this Ebola vaccine shows the public sector can and in fact does do far more in important instances."" The Ebola vaccine research had a serendipitous start in Canada more than two decades ago. German scientist Heinz Feldmann had already been studying hemorrhagic fevers when he joined the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), which had recently opened in Winnipeg. Once settled in the high security lab, he designed an experiment trying to identify the key protein that made Ebola so deadly. He didn't get the answer he expected. What he discovered instead was that the experimental mice were protected against the Ebola virus. It was the first evidence that an Ebola vaccine was possible.  At the time, the world had not yet experienced the full terror of an Ebola epidemic. That changed in 2014, when the virus ravaged West Africa, killing more than 11,000 people. Today, Congo is still struggling to control an outbreak that has killed more than 2,200 people. But in the early 2000s, the Ebola researchers in Canada had difficulty securing the funding they needed as they competed for money with other public health priorities.  Still, they managed to scrounge enough resources to conduct preliminary animal and toxicology studies as they tried to find a drug company interested in taking their promising vaccine research to market. But the documents reveal there was little commercial interest in an Ebola vaccine, especially in the years before the first major outbreak. So the scientists pushed onward, struggling to find funding and doing much of the development work normally done by industry. That included getting more than 1,000 doses of vaccine manufactured for use in human clinical trials. Herder points to that as proof that governments can, under certain circumstances, make life-saving medicines that have little commercial appeal. ""It provides evidence that a lot of that later-stage drug development or vaccine development can happen within the public sector,"" said Herder.  A small biotechnology company in Iowa called BioProtection Systems Inc., which later became NewLink Genetics, eventually stepped forward in 2006 offering to take the discovery to market. Herder said he examined a copy of the agreement between the Public Health Agency of Canada and NewLink and discovered that the company failed to deliver on commitments it made in exchange for the patent.  ""There's very little evidence in the documents that they were doing anything beyond taking part in meetings,"" Herder said. NewLink Genetics did not respond to CBC's request for comment. The documents also reveal that, by 2010, the vaccine project was at risk of being shelved due to lack of funding and the fact the lead researchers had left the NML for positions at other research institutions. ""We have evidence in the records that we obtained that the lab in Winnipeg thought seriously about stopping this work,"" Herder said. But one dedicated researcher managed to keep the project going. Judie Alimonti was a contract scientist at the NML. Despite her precarious position, she volunteered to take over the floundering Ebola vaccine file. Herder said she played a pivotal role. Without Alimonti's perseverance, the vaccine might never have been available for emergency use when Ebola ravaged West Africa in 2014. ""And so by virtue of it being ready, I'm sure she helped save lives in the middle of that epidemic."" Despite her commitment to developing the Ebola vaccine, Alimonti's contract was not renewed and she left the NML in 2015. She died of cancer two years later at age 57. Herder's research suggests that it was only after Ebola began spreading in West Africa and threatening the world that the vaccine project was treated with more urgency. ""Questions began to be raised publicly about the delay in development of a vaccine that had been shown to be 100% effective in animal models as early as 2004,"" Herder writes, citing a 2014 New York Times article with the headline: ""Ebola Vaccine, Ready for Test, Sat on the Shelf."" Canada donated 800 doses of its experimental vaccine for use during the outbreak. The federal government also continued to provide support for the clinical trials, including a Phase 1 trial at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax. Meanwhile, in the midst of the 2014 outbreak, NewLink transferred the Ebola vaccine patent to Merck for $50 million US. At the same time, funding for the research continued to be provided by public sector sources with more than $120 million from the Canadian and U.S. governments and the World Health Organization to support clinical trials during the epidemic, according to the paper.  Herder was unable to access the pharmaceutical industry documents, leaving him with questions about Merck's role. ""What the record does establish is that it was the public sector, not Merck, that provided all of the financing, including for clinical trials, during the West African epidemic, in addition to providing the technical expertise, human resources, and infrastructure that was necessary to carry out the trials,"" Herder writes. Merck spokesperson Elise Giasson told CBC News in an email that after acquiring the licence from NewLink in 2014, the companies ""worked together on moving it into additional Phase 1 trials as well as Phase 2/3 clinical trials."" ""Merck is proud to be part of the unprecedented global collaborations to aid in the fight against Ebola."" The vaccine, now known as Ervebo, was approved for commercial sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency over the past two months. It's a milestone that took too long, Herder suggests in his paper.  ""Instead of celebrating this milestone, our analysis raises the question as to whether [the Ebola vaccine] could have been available earlier if public laboratories had taken a different approach to the vaccine's development.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-national-microbiology-laboratory-pharmaceutical-industry-scientists-1.5429060,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-congo-outbreak-1.5201697 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-20-2019-1.5252290/canadian-made-ebola-vaccine-could-have-saved-more-lives-if-research-was-funded-earlier-microbiologist-says-1.5252292 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-relapse-congo-1.5404082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/glybera-lpld-rare-drug-orphan-disease-nrc-cbc-price-1.5312177,/news/health/ebola-vaccine-congo-outbreak-1.5201697 /radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-20-2019-1.5252290/canadian-made-ebola-vaccine-could-have-saved-more-lives-if-research-was-funded-earlier-microbiologist-says-1.5252292 /news/health/ebola-relapse-congo-1.5404082 /news/health/glybera-lpld-rare-drug-orphan-disease-nrc-cbc-price-1.5312177

The Nairobi-headquartered charity said in a report released ahead of the annual World Economic Forum of political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, that women around the world work 12.5 billion hours combined each day without pay or recognition. In its Time to Care report, Oxfam said it estimated that unpaid care work by women added at least $10.8 trillion a year in value to the world economy — three times more than the tech industry. ""It is important for us to underscore that the hidden engine of the economy that we see is really the unpaid care work of women. And that needs to change,"" Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India, told Reuters in an interview. To highlight the level of inequality in the global economy, Behar cited the case of a woman called Buchu Devi in India who spends 16 to 17 hours a day doing work like fetching water after trekking three kilometres, cooking, preparing her children for school and working in a poorly paid job. ""And on the one hand you see the billionaires who are all assembling at Davos with their personal planes, personal jets, super rich lifestyles,"" he said. ""This Buchu Devi is not one person. In India [I] encounter these women on a daily basis, and this is the story across the world. We need to change this, and certainly end this billionaire boom."" Behar said that to remedy this, governments should make sure above all that the rich pay their taxes, which should then be used to pay for amenities such as clean water, healthcare and better quality schools. ""If you just look around the world, more than 30 countries are seeing protests. People are on the street and what are they saying? That they are not to accept this inequality, they are not going to live with these kind of conditions,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rich-poor-oxfam-report-divide-1.5432930,[],/news/business/world-s-85-richest-own-more-than-3-5-billion-poorest-un-report-says-1.2717114 /news/business/billionaires-wealth-falls-first-time-2015-1.5352731
439,Jason Proctor,2020-01-21T00:47:15.560Z,"Meng Wanzhou case is about the U.S. wanting Canada to enforce sanctions it rejects, defence says","Meng Wanzhou's lawyers appealed to Canadian independence Monday as they accused the U.S. of trying to use Canada to enforce economic sanctions Canadians have rejected in order to extradite the Huawei executive. Defence lawyer Richard Peck kicked off the start of Meng's formal extradition hearing in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver by telling Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that despite the Crown's claims to the contrary, the case is all about U.S. sanctions against Iran. ""It's all based on sanctions,"" Peck said in his opening statement. ""In the end, we're being asked to impose on Canada an obligation to assist the U.S. in the enforcement of its sanctions — sanctions that we have expressly rejected."" Peck said any attempt to suggest otherwise was a ""facade."" ""Canada is a sovereign nation. We have our own heritage, our own ethos, our own identity, our own standards, our own laws,"" he said. ""Canadians and Canadian courts have never hesitated to protect these values in the face of adversity — let alone on request or demand."" A lineup of cameras greeted Meng on her way to court this morning, as she left the multimillion-dollar Vancouver home where she lives under house arrest.  The 47-year-old chief financial officer of China-based telecommunications giant Huawei waved to supporters, some wishing her a happy Chinese New Year, as she arrived at the downtown courthouse about 15 minutes later. The week-long hearing comes more than a year after Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018. American prosecutors want Meng sent to New York to face fraud charges related to allegations she deceived banks about Huawei's control of a company accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Over five days this week, her defence team and lawyers for Canada's attorney general will debate the question of so-called double criminality — specifically, whether the offence Meng is accused of would be considered a crime if her alleged conduct had happened in Canada. WATCH | Meng leaves her Vancouver home, greets a throng of cameras at court: Meng has made a point of displaying the GPS-monitoring ankle bracelet she wears as part of the terms of her $10-million bail agreement. She wore a black dress with giant white polka dots as she made her way, flanked by security guards, into the giant courtroom. It's the same courtroom where her bail hearing was held. Glass walls cut the lawyers and Meng off from a public gallery that holds about 150 people. The gallery was overflowing and Holmes announced the court was planning to broadcast the proceedings into the overflow area. The defence is expected to use about two days of court time, to be followed by the Crown's submissions. Both sides have filed arguments in advance of the hearing. The Crown plans to argue that the ""essence"" of the conduct is what is important in Canadian extradition as opposed to ""offence-matching"" laws on either side of the border. They say Meng is charged with fraud in that she is accused of making a misrepresentation that put banks at risk of loss. But Peck rejected that logic, saying it was a ""fiction"" to suggest the U.S. had any interest that didn't involve sanctions when it came to policing the private dealings between foreign citizens and their banks. He ran through the history of U.S. sanctions against Iran and Canada's decision to drop economic sanctions against the Islamic republic as a result of an international deal to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. He said the U.S. decided to implement sanctions again in 2018 when President Donald Trump left the treaty. But Canada did not follow suit. ""That move was out of step with the international community,"" Peck said.  ""What it resulted in was a decision by the United States to criminalize conduct that Canada and most of the other countries, if not all, permit."" The courtroom was filled with an array of onlookers, including lawyers from other parts of the building, students and numerous Huawei employees, many of whom have made a habit of attending the proceedings. During the afternoon, Holmes interrupted Peck's co-counsel Eric Gottardi as he discussed the elements of fraud. She asked him whether a person could be successfully prosecuted in Canada given the same set of circumstances, but with the alleged lie being told in Canada instead of Hong Kong. Gottardi seemed to indicate that they probably could. The judge then asked why the same consideration wouldn't apply to an extradition hearing. He told her he would need the night to ""crystallize"" his answer. Media from around the world have obtained court accreditation in advance of this week's hearing. Mo Vayeghan, a Vancouver criminal defence and extradition lawyer, says the case is unusual and largely without precedent, but the Crown has a good chance at success. ""American prosecutors understand that the allegations they are making need to meet the test of dual criminality,"" he said. ""They get this issue. That is why the United States prosecutors, in their indictment, they have worded their allegations broadly to include misrepresentations and fraudulent activity."" If the defence succeeds in convincing Holmes the bar of double criminality has not been met, the extradition proceedings against Meng would come to an end. But the court has scheduled a series of other hearings if necessary. Those include a week of arguments in June in which the defence will claim that Meng's rights were violated when she was detained by Canada Border Services Agency officers for three hours before her arrest by RCMP. Meng's lawyers will also argue that she is being used as a political pawn in the U.S. and China's trade battle. Her lawyers have cited comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who told Reuters shortly after her arrest that he would intervene in the case if it would help get the U.S. a better trade deal with China. Trump signed an initial trade deal with China last week, with no sign that he had heeded a suggestion from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December that any pact should deal with Meng and two Canadians who were detained in China shortly after her arrest. Entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were later formally arrested and now face accusations of spying in China, where they are incarcerated without access to lawyers or family. China has also cut off Canadian canola and meat imports in the past year, lifting a ban on pork and beef in November.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149,https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/live-blog/meng-wanzhou-extradition-hearing-live?scribble_id=2919008 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia /news/canada/british-columbia/surrey-crash-rcmp-firetruck-carmichael-park-police-fire-1.5430780 /news/canada/british-columbia/tenants-vacate-unsafe-building-langford-bc-1.5431210 /news/canada/british-columbia/paramedics-long-commute-metro-vancouver-1.5429708
440,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-17T14:58:18.301Z,B.C. appoints special prosecutor to probe Crown conduct in decade-old child murder case,"The office of B.C.'s attorney general has appointed one of the country's top defence lawyers to probe the conduct of prosecutors involved in a second-degree murder charge laid against a babysitter in 2011. Marilyn Sandford, a Vancouver lawyer, was named as a special prosecutor Wednesday following inquiries by CBC's The Fifth Estate about why defence counsel was not provided a key report that contradicted evidence used to charge Tammy Bouvette of Cranbrook, B.C., with murder. In May 2011, the then-28-year-old babysitter called 911 after she found 19-month-old Iyanna Teeple unresponsive in a bathtub. Iyanna was flown to Calgary for treatment, where she eventually died. Retired RCMP Cpl. Chris Faulkner told The Fifth Estate's Mark Kelley that the Mounties originally considered the death a tragic accident, after Bouvette said she left the baby to attend to a spill in another room. ""I don't believe that she ever intended to kill the child,"" Faulkner said. ""And there's nothing in our investigation that would state that she intended to cause the death."" That all changed after a B.C. prosecutor heard from a Calgary medical examiner in October 2011. Court documents obtained by The Fifth Estate show that the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, Dr. Evan Matshes, told prosecutors there was ""no benign"" explanation for some injuries found on the toddler and he identified bruising that was ""typical of child abuse.""  Three weeks after speaking with Matshes, B.C. prosecutors charged Bouvette. RCMP praised the ""efforts of the medical examiner in Calgary"" as being ""instrumental in pushing the case forward."" The Fifth Estate discovered that medical experts were asked to review the autopsy after concerns were raised about some of Matshes' other findings. Alberta Justice had convened an expert panel to analyze his findings in 14 cases, including Iyanna's. The panel of three forensic pathologists stated in their report that the comments Matshes made to the prosecutor about ""intentional injuries"" on the body and prior abuse were ""unreasonable."" Bouvette's lawyer, Jesse Gelber, told The Fifth Estate he did not receive that review, despite asking the Crown prosecutor if further disclosure was available. ""I had no idea, that was not disclosed to me,"" said Gelber. By law, prosecutors must provide defence counsel with all relevant documents in a criminal case. Without knowing about the panel finding in her favour, Bouvette pleaded guilty to criminal negligence in order to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. ""I would say without qualification that Tammy Bouvette is a victim of a miscarriage of justice,"" said James Lockyer, a lawyer with Innocence Canada who has reviewed the case files obtained by The Fifth Estate. ""We know from wrongful conviction cases in Canada … that people pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit because they were facing a murder charge, and so to avoid the potential life sentence took a plea to a lesser crime for a shorter sentence."" For his part, Gelber said the damage will never go away for his client. ""There was a horrible stigma, and that stigma even extended to her family and her children,"" he said. ""It was devastating for her."" The Fifth Estate found Bouvette, now 36, living homeless in New Westminster, just outside of Vancouver. ""I am not a baby-killer … People just look at me differently like I was some type of monster and I'm not,"" she said, before the special prosecutor was appointed. ""I'm a loving person and a loving mom."" Bouvette said knowing about the panel's review of the autopsy has taken ""a big weight off my chest, it makes a big difference."" Still, she will not forgive those who did not disclose that information when it would have really mattered. ""Shame on them for not doing their job right,"" Bouvette said. ""It has taken everything from me: my freedom, my whole self, everything."" The Fifth Estate investigation has found that other autopsy reviews were also not provided to defence lawyers in two other second-degree murder cases in Alberta. In a statement, Eric Tolppanen, head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, said Alberta Justice provided the documentation in Bouvette's case to B.C. Crown prosecutors.  The Fifth Estate later inquired with the B.C. Prosecution Service about whether it had received those documents. After waiting for a response for several days, journalists received the notice that the special prosecutor would be investigating the service's conduct. The statement said the investigations results will be released at an ""appropriate time"" and that neither the Prosecution Service nor the special prosecutor ""will comment further."" Tolppanen also said he views the findings of the expert panel as ""inconsequential"" because the Alberta government agreed to quash the findings after Matshes went to court. An Alberta Queen's Bench justice ruled that the panel's review was not fair to Matshes and that he had not been given enough time to respond or provide additional materials. Although Alberta Justice agreed to the quashing. its lawyer told the court it was ""integral to the administration of justice"" that a second panel investigate the accuracy of Matshes' work. That was more than six years ago. So far there has been no second panel. Matshes continues to stand by his work.

441,Anonymous,2020-01-17T22:01:05.496Z,"Pay-as-you-go health care: Uninsured people in Canada face sky-high bills, delays in treatment, doctors say","In a Scarborough, Ont., clinic, a woman receives test results with news no one wants to hear: she has stage three breast cancer. But along with the prospect of chemotherapy, radiation and a mastectomy, she's also facing a bill in the thousands, because she doesn't have health insurance. CBC Radio is calling her Grace because she fears she may risk being deported if her identity is revealed. She came to Canada legally in 2001 as part of the live-in caregiver program, but lost her job — and her status — before she could complete it. ""I feel like it's ripping me apart,"" she said. ""I have to put [on] a brave face just like nothing happened."" Grace first detected a lump last August. She paid hundreds of dollars for a mammogram and ultrasound at a walk-in clinic — but without a financial guarantor, couldn't afford a biopsy to get a diagnosis. In the meantime, she was prescribed antibiotics and Tylenol for the pain. The Canadian Centre for Refugee and Immigrant Healthcare (CCIRH) agreed to do the diagnostics at no cost to Grace. The clinic's volunteer oncologist who delivered the news told White Coat, Black Art host Dr. Brian Goldman she's likely looking at treatment at a cost north of $10,000. According to a 2016 report by the Wellesley Institute, an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people live in Canada without health insurance. They could be landed immigrants living in Ontario, Quebec or B.C., which mandate a three-month waiting period before provincial health benefits kick in. They could also be temporary foreign workers who remained in Canada after their contracts ended, refugee claimants or people seeking asylum. Veteran family doctor Dr. Paul Caulford, who works at the CCRIH clinic, calls the 500,000 figure a ""conservative estimate."" ""Health equity is the issue here. As physicians … we try our best to create health equity access, to reduce the health disparities that happen within our population,"" he said. For the last 18 years, Grace has been working under the table at factory and babysitting jobs, keeping herself afloat and sending money to her family back home. She would have been able to apply for permanent residency after working for 24 months over three years in the then live-in caregiver program. But she says she lost her job and status after being ""hunted"" by her abusive husband. ""I came here looking for a greener pasture; that someday I can take my children here,"" she said. A health scare in 2012 landed her in the emergency ward. She came out with a new pacemaker and a bill in the tens of thousands. She's paid most of it out of her own pocket. ""I thought, Oh my God. Will I die of the bill, or will I die of the sickness?"" A 2013 report by the Toronto Board of Health characterized the medical charges billed to uninsured residents as ""inconsistent,"" and noted that they often don't know how much they will be charged before treatment. ""Key informants note that hospitals often bill uninsured residents at rates substantially higher than OHIP rates, resulting in exorbitant charges that they cannot afford,"" the report said. Caulford is calling on Ontario to waive the three-month wait period for OHIP coverage for people applying for immigration status in the province.  ""Ontario has an obligation under international law to ensure that all residents can effectively access essential health care services,"" the province's human rights commissioner wrote in a July 2019 letter to Health Minister Christine Elliott. Caulford also says it should be mandatory for health-care practitioners and agencies to enrol in the Interim Federal Health (IFH) program, which offers limited health coverage like dental and vision services for refugee claimants and asylum seekers. In 2012, the Conservative government made cuts to the program, but the Federal Court ruled those cuts violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Liberal government reversed the cuts in 2016, and in July 2019 announced a $283 million infusion in response to the surge of asylum claims in the last few years. Caulford says the 2012 cuts led to confusion about how IFH actually works, and that many physicians refuse to enrol as a result, even today. ""Right now, we see patients with their IFH … go to a walk-in clinic for an infection, and the walk-in clinic won't see them. They'll charge them $100 or $150 to be seen,"" he said. White Coat, Black Art reached out to Health Minister Patty Hajdu's office for comment.  The request was forwarded to the Ministry of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, which responded in part by noting that ""publicly funded health insurance is a provincial responsibility."" In Vancouver, pediatrician Dr. Anamaria Richardson is worried about four-year-old Renata, who arrived illegally with her mother from Mexico three years ago. They met at Watari, a counselling and support service community for the city's Latin American community. Richardson says Renata is non-verbal, and may have autism spectrum disorder. Because her condition isn't life-threatening, diagnostic tests or treatment aren't available without payment, which the family cannot afford. Renata's mother, who does not speak English, told Richardson she worries that getting even routine medical care puts them at risk of being deported. ""Two years ago she needed to take Renata to a consult with a doctor, and she said it turned into just an immigration questionnaire,"" said Richardson. ""I think it's so unfair."" She says she understands why some Canadians might object to coverage for non-citizens, especially when health-care budgets are strained. But she believes capacity exists for patients like Grace and Renata. ""I understand that it is a very costly venture. However, we live in a country that has so much, and I feel like we need to at least bring light to the issue,"" she said. The CCRIH clinic operates on private donations and a small amount of money from the provincial government. ""It runs out about five months into the year ... we're going on fumes for about seven months,"" Caulford said. Doctors, nurse practitioners and other health-care providers volunteer their time to work there, donating the small government stipend they receive back to the clinic to help keep it afloat. During a visit earlier this month, Caulford says he was alarmed at how dramatically Grace's tumour has grown since the fall. ""As a physician, we see so much. [But] I just stepped backwards when I saw this thickened, inflamed, red … warm, hot mass that was eight centimetres that started out at two to three centimetres in October,"" he said. Promisingly, a CT scan funded by donations revealed that while the cancer spread to her lymph nodes, her bones, lungs and liver are clear. Caulford has reached out to several doctors about Grace's situation, and two breast surgeons have offered to waive their fees to help with treatment. He hopes to start chemotherapy soon with the donations they've gathered already and hopefully raise more — ""on a lot of faith."" But he wishes it didn't need to come to this. ""Grace has been working here for 20 years. ... When does she become Canadian enough for us to care enough, without being too judgmental?"" Written by Jonathan Ore.

Officials with the Canadian Red Cross said the woman rented the house. They said volunteers have arranged emergency lodging, food, winter clothing purchases and some other basics for her. When firefighters arrived, the fire had reached inside and outside the house, said O'Leary Deputy Chief Jason Greenan. He said the fire was working its way through the attic of the storey-and-a-half dwelling. A fire this morning caused major damage to a house in O'Leary, <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PEI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PEI</a>. This video is from neighbour Jo-anne Smallman, who woke up to the smell of smoke. No one was hurt. <a href=""https://t.co/4Lu7YN3z8q"">pic.twitter.com/4Lu7YN3z8q</a> ""So it took a lot of ventilation and a lot of cutting to get to it,"" he said. ""But eventually we did. The only bad part is of course the house is practically destroyed because of it. Water damage and fire damage."" Firefighters worked for more than six hours to put out the fire. The fire marshal is investigating the blaze. Jo-Anne Smallman lives next door to the house. She said her daughter woke to hear firefighters breaking through windows next door. ""She proceeded to come down because the smoke was starting to come into our house and she turned off our heat pump because she didn't know if that was creating the smoke to come into our home,"" she said.  ""We could see there was a lot of smoke and the firemen ... were dealing with the fire.""  Smallman described the scene as shocking.  ""It was kind of scary not really knowing whether it could get out of control and affect my home.""  She said her neighbour's house looks devastated.  ""When I left there were holes in it, the windows were smashed in it, you know, there was a lot of smoke coming from it. It was really hard for me to even see."" Smallman and her daughter gathered a few items and left their home. She said her house also sustained some damage and she is waiting to hear from her insurance company.  Smallman said she doesn't expect to be back in her home for several days.   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-o-leary-house-fire-1.5432656,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snowfall-warning-still-in-effect-1.5432545 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-mental-health-podcast-jan-2020-1.5427496,[]

The City of St. John's and surrounding municipalities declared a state of emergency Friday as the province was hit with snow and high winds. Eastern Newfoundland is expected to receive more than 75 centimetres of snow and winds are expected to gust to as high as 150 km/h. Residents have been told to stay home, and that includes taxi drivers.  Taxi company Jiffy Cabs said this the first time in the business's history that it ever pulled its entire fleet off the road. From his home in St. John's, White told As It Happens host Carol Off his advice for how people should weather the storm.   So you've been out snowblowing. What's the point, given the fact that it just keeps coming down?  I work seven days a week and I get really put out when I can't get out and go to work. And if I leave that until tomorrow morning … it'll be probably up to my shoulders.  We've seen the videos, we're seeing the pictures. … You just can't fathom what's happening right now on your part on the Avalon Peninsula. Just describe what it's like outside your door? When that snow hits your face, it's like someone has a sand blaster. You can't even look at it. You have to be very careful when you're snowblowing, especially near the street, because even though it's a state of emergency, there's still some fools out there in pickup trucks trying to see what their trucks can do.  When you get a northeast wind like that … that must be just brutal. A northeast wind in St. John's will cut you right to the bone. You might get a northeast wind up in Toronto and other places and I've heard meteorologists say, ""Nah, it's the same."" It's not the same. The meteorologists gotta come down here and stand up in it and then they'll understand. Three times today, I got my snow gear in the dryer again. Because the humidity that's in this stuff just soaks you right to the bone. I mean, you can go up in Toronto and blow snow and stuff like that, and it's cold. But it's not a damp cold. We get a damp cold down here. I lived in Ontario for a couple of years and the windchill up there of –30 C is nothing. But a wind chill down here of –20 C or –30 C — I mean, it's not fit.  It has now become impossible to even speak to the camera outside in St. John’s. We are pulling in. Besides, I’ve run out of words to describe it. I’m pretty much speechless. And that never happens. This is extraordinary. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLStorm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NLStorm</a> <a href=""https://t.co/SqtvVYqln0"">pic.twitter.com/SqtvVYqln0</a> When was the last time you didn't go out in your cab because of the weather?  Never. I've been into the taxi industry since 1979. I've gone through more cars than most people go through shoes and the weather has never ever prevented me from going to work.  So what makes you so convinced that you're going to get out to work tomorrow?  I'm just persistent. I'm going to work tomorrow morning.  What we're hearing from the police and the authorities are saying, ""Just do not go out there today."" But are people doing that anyway? You said you saw some pickup trucks. People are actually out on the road? I saw one pickup truck, that was earlier … a few hours ago. I haven't seen one since.  I live out in the west end and a lot of people around here have snowmobiles. I haven't even heard one. So I think the teenagers got the message so stay home. If you don't need to be out, stay home. Stay home, make some babies, and then you'll be able to remember what happened.  But I'm going to work tomorrow morning. You needn't worry about that. And my customers, they know that I'll be out working tomorrow morning. I told them already. I'll be out.  Written by Sarah Jackson. Produced by Chris Harbord.

444,"Jennie Russell, Charles Rusnell",2020-01-17T18:58:14.664Z,Alberta chief medical examiner Dr. Elizabeth Brooks-Lim resigns,"Alberta's chief medical examiner has resigned, the third departure from that position in five years. In a statement released Thursday, Dr. Elizabeth Brooks-Lim said it was a ""personal decision"" to leave the job and she is looking forward to the next chapter in her career.  ""I am confident that a strong transition team is in place, and that staff will continue to provide a high level of service to Albertans,"" she said in a statement sent to CBC News.  The statement doesn't indicate when exactly Brooks-Lim will leave, but in another statement the ministry thanked her for ""affording us the time to appoint an acting chief medical examiner during the recruitment period."" In September, CBC News broadcast video that showed a body being dragged along the floor of a refrigerated semi-trailer outside the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Alberta (OCME) in Edmonton. Brooks-Lim had ordered the trailer's use as temporary storage in response to a sudden influx of bodies.  Storage of bodies in rented trailer leads to probe of medical examiner's space shortage Brooks-Lim was appointed chief medical examiner in December 2016 following a string of controversies involving the troubled office. Her predecessor, Dr. Jeffery Gofton, quit after less than 18 months on the job and returned to his native United States. Gofton assumed the post from Dr. Anny Sauvageau, who is suing Alberta Justice for more than $5 million, alleging her contract, which expired at the end of 2014, was not renewed after she stood up to political interference in the office's operation. In a 2016 report, Alberta's Public Interest Commissioner concluded Sauvageau had been treated unfairly by Justice officials who had, in part, used complaints they knew were unsubstantiated to justify not renewing her contract. The report said records showed there was even an attempt to solicit complaints and comments about Sauvageau from both inside and outside the department. The commissioner dismissed Sauvageau's allegations of political interference, however, saying there was insufficient evidence for a finding of wrongdoing. When former NDP Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley appointed Brooks-Lim to the position, Ganley said it would ""maintain stability in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner."" Brooks-Lim had been serving as acting chief medical examiner. Brooks-Lim was previously deputy chief medical examiner in Edmonton, assistant chief medical examiner in Calgary and Edmonton, and a forensic pathologist and coroner in Saskatchewan. She was a forensic pathologist in England and a clinical lecturer in forensic medicine and pathology in Scotland. The Alberta government's public salary disclosure shows Brooks-Lim received nearly $404,000 in total compensation in 2018. Brooks-Lim was directly involved in a controversy in September that critics called a clear lack of respect to decedents.  CBC News revealed the OCME was storing an influx of bodies on the floor of a rented, refrigerated semi-trailer — visible from a nearby public street — as the office grappled with a shortage of storage space. Internal emails show a staff member had previously raised concerns with Brooks-Lim about the propriety of storing bodies in a trailer, saying families likely would not find the practice acceptable.  In response, Brooks-Lim told the employee: ""The floor is clean, the bodies will be in body bags and the families do not need to be informed of the storage procedures."" CBC News recorded video of a funeral home attendant dragging one of the bodies, sheathed in a white body bag, along the floor of the trailer.  After the story aired, Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer directed his ministry to begin an internal investigation. But the ministry refuses to say when the investigation would be completed or if it would be publicly released.  CBC News subsequently learned the Alberta Justice investigation into the incident was also trying to determine who had leaked that email exchange. The family of the person in the body bag learned about the dragging incident from the funeral home manager and Brooks-Lim, who both personally apologized. Raymond Pizzey, the brother of the deceased man, Bryce Sather, said the family was distraught over his body's mistreatment. Pizzey is now suing the funeral home for significant emotional distress. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is entangled in yet another scandal after a six-month investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate revealed senior officials at Alberta Justice were aware of a report that shook the foundations of several murder charges and cast into doubt numerous findings of medical examiner Dr. Evan Matshes in Calgary a decade ago. Matshes declined to speak with The Fifth Estate but in a statement he said he stands by his work.  ""I have devoted my professional life to making sure that the criminal justice system holds those guilty responsible for their crimes and does not prosecute the innocent,"" Matshes wrote.

Cardy's green paper on education reform was published last fall. The 25-page document discusses eliminating grade levels, more use of artificial intelligence in the classroom, more partnerships with the private sector to boost education in the trades and the introduction of second-language programming in daycares. ""This can't be just politicians saying, 'We should do this,'"" Cardy said.  ""It has to be a conversation with the public because it's their education system, their children and our province's future at stake with this."" The consultation sessions will give students, teachers, parents, school employees and community partners a chance to meet with Cardy and bring forward any concerns.   Some of those concerns include the possibility of eliminating a grade system.  Cardy admits parents have expressed concern over the elimination of a grade level system, which could negatively impact students with special needs. But Cardy says that won't happen.   ""I'll be reassuring folks that absolutely not, that's not the case. But I wouldn't be surprised if that comes up.""   He's also anticipating fielding questions about second-language training and French immersion in the province. This comes after the Telegraph-Journal released a report earlier this month, claiming Cardy planned to scrap French immersion.  Cardy called the report inaccurate and said no other changes beyond those mentioned in the green paper are in the works.  People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin was mentioned in the article saying he had been in secret talks with Cardy and Premier Blaine Higgs about doing away with the program. Cardy called Austin's comments ""inaccurate"" and ""irresponsible.""  Cardy has not yet spoken with Austin about the debacle. Public consultation sessions will take place from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m in the following eight locations:  Consultations will be rescheduled to Feb. 13, 18 or 19 if there is a storm.  Cardy received overwhelming response from people who attended the three-day education summit held last fall. Cardy also wants to hear from students. The fall summit took place during the work week and during school hours, making it difficult for students to attend.

Bulger had been living at a house in O'Leary owned by her brother, for about a year. She and Missy were the only ones home when the fire broke out. When she woke up to the sound of Missy barking just before 6 a.m., Bulger at first told the dog to go lay down.  ""She was just so persisting, and she wouldn't listen to me,"" Bulger said.  ""So I got up, I got up and checked the front door thinking maybe somebody's at the front door, and there was nobody there and I just, out of the corner of my eye, I looked out and the back deck and everything was just nothing but flames coming out."" Bulger and Missy were able to escape the house before it became engulfed in flames.  ""The only thing I took out is what I was wearing.""    Firefighters from O'Leary, West Point and Alberton responded to the call, and spent more than six hours working to put out the blaze.  ""It was just flames everywhere,"" Bulger said. When she returned to the house later, she said everything was destroyed. ""Everything is just, it's just a mess,"" Bulger said. ""You have to really see it, the pictures don't do it justice."" Bulger is receiving assistance from the Red Cross, including three nights at a hotel, and some money for food and clothing.  She said she's grateful for the help, but isn't sure where she'll go next.  ""I've been phoning around all morning seeing if anybody has anything to rent, and there doesn't seem anything available around here.""

According to the Pokemon fan site Bulbapedia, it has only ever been awarded in similar competitions, for instance the annual Pokemon World Championships. Only a few dozen copies are known to exist. Trainer No. 1 and 2 cards are awarded to first-place and second-place winners, respectively. ""Think of it as an Olympic medal, but rarer,"" Zaid said. The saga began in August 2018, when an eBay seller known as pokemonplace sold the card to the collector in Dubai. It was initially posted for $85,000, but the buyer negotiated the price down to a bargain $60,000.  The seller told video game news website Polygon it was their responsibility to ship the card to a middleman company, which would then ship it to the buyer.  That's where things seemed to go wrong. ""The way this process worked was you could track it from the U.S. Postal Service to the shipping facility in Queens with Aramex — and then it disappears,"" Zaid said.  Zaid said that according to the package's tracking information, the card arrived at Aramex's New York location, where a representative signed for a ""bulk lot"" of multiple items without checking if the card was there. ""Unfortunately that's not how shipping works and it's not our problem,"" Zaid said of Aramax's explanation. Zaid thinks it's more likely that the card was misplaced, rather than stolen. The buyer is suing the company for the loss of the sales purchase, attorney's fees and possibly other types of punitive damages. Aramex did not respond to As It Happens' request for comment.  Zaid is also the lawyer for the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. But a large part of his practice is dedicated to collectibles cases. ""As much as I'm involved with these interesting matters that have been in the news lately, this [missing card] is actually a very typical case for me,"" he said. He is also a part-time comic book dealer and collector of high-end items like ""historic documents of presidents and supreme court justices and famous people from around the world."" Written by Sarah Jackson.

448,Rafferty Baker,2020-01-21T00:58:13.224Z,"ICBC to start ranking collision, auto glass shops in effort to save cash","ICBC is planning to introduce a new public ranking system for the province's collision and auto glass shops, in an effort to cut down on repair costs. The changes, announced Monday, will begin Feb. 3 for collision repair shops, and Mar. 2 for glass shops, though the public won't be able to see how repair shops are ranked until ICBC has collected the required data. ""I believe for the industry's perspective, there's going to be growing pains, certainly, but we need grow — that's a good thing,"" said Adrian Scovell, president and CEO of Automotive Retailers Association, which represents shops responsible for more than 80 per cent of the business for which ICBC pays. ""ICBC will save money. It's a good program for them,"" said Scovell, explaining that the shops that get top rankings will be the shops that are more efficient. He said the ranking will be based on three tiers, with the top tier capable of doing work on high-end, complicated vehicles like BMWs and Range Rovers, that require standards in line with the original manufacturers. Scovell said the shops that land in the lowest tier will hopefully be encouraged by the public ranking to improve their operations and do better work. Sabi Bains, director of material damage and special investigations at ICBC, said most shops will likely fall into the second tier, and it's possible the top tier will have many of the shops that do high-end work, but not necessarily. ""All shops could qualify for tier one,"" said Bains. ""It could be the small local shops, but the run a very efficient business, they're good with their customer satisfaction scores, good with their efficiency scores, so there's a number of key elements that are in there."" She said it will be up to the customers to decide where they take their vehicles, and tier two shops will still be good shops. Bains said the public rankings won't be available for several months, but they will be posted before the end of 2020. ""The redesign of the collision and glass repair programs will improve transparency and accountability of repair shops for drivers who get into accidents and need to choose which repair shop they go to,"" said Attorney General David Eby in a written statement. According to Eby, the added competition — as shops vy for better rankings — will ""help curb some of the rising claims costs and pressures that ICBC is facing."" This is the latest change to the insurer in the last couple of years as Eby tries to improve the crown corporation's dire financial situation. In Jan. 2018, Eby referred to the state of ICBC as a ""dumpster fire,"" when it was announced the insurer was facing a $1.3 billion loss. According to Eby's ministry, efforts to turn the financial outlook at ICBC around include improvements to road safety, high-friction pavement, and limits to minor injury payments.

449,Logan Perley,2020-01-20T10:00:00.598Z,P.E.I. quill artist scans roadsides for the remains that let her work,"Melissa Peter-Paul drives from her home in the Abegweit First Nation in Prince Edward Island to gather the materials she needs for her art. But it's not paint or clay she comes to collect. It's roadkill.  Peter-Paul is a quillwork artist. She uses porcupine quills to create intricate designs that can stand alone in a frame or adorn wood, leather and other materials.  Her medium is a prickly one and one not readily available to her. She has to harvest the quills from dead porcupines she finds on the side of the road. Porcupines are not native to Prince Edward Island. Peter-Paul scours the highways of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to find carcasses to load into her cooler and take back to her home in Scotchfort, about 25 kilometres notheast of  Charlottetown. Once there, she painstakingly separates the porcupine fur with one hand and uses the other to pluck the quills. Tens of thousands of them. Porcupine quilling is an art form unique to North America. The use of quills to add ornamentation to clothing, jewelry, medicine bags and boxes can be dated back to the sixth century. Many quillers switched to beadwork when beads became readily available. It requires the same skills as quillwork, but it's less gruelling. Quillwork is nearly a lost art.  But people like Peter-Paul are keeping it alive. For her, it's more than a job. Porcupine quilling is a calling.  ""As soon as I picked up the quills, it was like this is what I was meant to do,"" Peter-Paul said. ""You wait all your life to find out what you want to be when you grow up. In that moment I was like 'this is it!'"" Peter-Paul goes through about half a dozen porcupines a year for her art. One porcupine can yield around 30,000 quills.  The ancient indigenous art form involves softening and dying the quills and weaving them onto leather or birch bark for ornamentation.  Peter-Paul said quilling has been integral to her Mi'kmaq identity. ""The ancestors' presence when I do quillwork is so strong and I really feed off of it."" Her interest began in 2014, when she took a workshop from her cousin who was visiting from Nova Scotia.  At first, it began with triangles and other simple patterns. It evolved into more intricate designs inspired by an old book Peter-Paul read on Mi'kmaq quillwork.   The pictures in the book are black and white. Peter-Paul said the vistas of the Island inspired her to bring colour to the designs and make them her own.  ""I saw lupines and I saw the red clay, and then I saw the ocean waves and the grass, and I used all those colours.""  Peter-Paul went on to complete a 20-week apprenticeship with her cousin and eventually to conduct her own workshops across the Maritimes. For Peter-Paul, quilling has revived a family tradition that was lost over generations. Her great-great-grandmother was a quiller. Her works have been archived at the Nova Scotia Museum in Halifax. Without having a mentor in the province, Peter-Paul looks to the art of her ancestors for inspiration, often helped along by the soul-cleansing smoke produced by smudging, the practice of burning sacred medicines. ""When I'm stuck on something, I have to light up my smudge and I pray … so when I'm sitting there with those old quill pieces, it's almost like I'm jumping into a time machine and I'm getting all of the answers.""  Her grandmother and mother were both basket makers. Peter-Paul said likes to incorporate sweet grass into her work, because her grandmother would harvest it by the river near her community for her baskets.  ""It's really important to me to still be using all of our traditional materials in that connection with my grandmother.""  Today, there are about half a dozen quillers on the Island.  Peter-Paul has exhibited her work with other artisans in the province. This past summer, she had her first solo exhibit in downtown Charlottetown and in November, she won the P.E.I. arts grant, the only Indigenous woman to receive the grant this year. ""I have people that still encourage me to keep this going because everybody else sees the importance of keeping quill work going.""  Peter-Paul is also a mother. Just as she has looked to the voices of her ancestors to guide and inspire her in her art, she now tries to bestow that wisdom on her two children.  ""My oldest son is 12, so he's harvesting porcupine with me. My children are all a part of my process and I make sure this is their normal. They see a porcupine on my step and they're like, 'Oh, hey, Mom's working today.' This is their normal."" Peter Paul laughed as she spoke.  ""So my boys will be quillers."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/made-from-this-land-quillwork-1.5384150,[],/news/indigenous/point-of-view-wolastoqey-language-1.5365334 /news/canada/new-brunswick/ned-bear-wooden-masks-1.5368129 /news/canada/new-brunswick/from-potato-fields-to-art-galleries-made-from-this-land-1.5341024

The year-old bear was driven there in an open-sided kennel in the bed of a conservation officer's truck, he said. It was –9 C and the bear was in rough shape, Wagstaffe said. ""He had ice ... attached to his fur,"" he said. ""His temperature wasn't regulated at all. His core body temperature was extremely low for a bear with the added implications of being over-sedated."" The bear, which weighed about 40 pounds, had been given about three times the necessary amount of sedation, Wagstaffe said. Animals cannot regulate their body temperature when sedated, he added. ""He could have died,"" he said. ""I'm surprised he survived."" It's not clear where the bear came from or why it was on its own, but Wagstaffe said he'd heard a report about an orphaned bear cub in Port Moody, B.C., days earlier. The bear was brought into the clinic and staff worked to warm him up. Wagstaffe said he tended to the cub every two hours for 24 hours to get him on track again.  Wagstaffe said he offered the conservation officer blankets to wrap around the kennel next time, but the officer said they wouldn't be necessary. Wagstaffe said it's not the first time he's been concerned about the care an animal has received from a conservation officer. He's calling on the province to revisit its policies for animal care.  ""We are just done with this,"" he said. ""We want COs to take proper care of these animals."" In an emailed statement, Ministry of Environment spokesman David Karn said the bear was tranquilized ""to ensure its safety"" before it was placed into the enclosure in the truck and brought to the rehabilitation facility.  ""Conservation officers are trained in the proper handling and care of animals, which includes guidance from our provincial wildlife veterinarian on the safe transportation of bear cubs to rehabilitation centres,"" Karn said. Wagstaffe said Critter Care currently has 29 bears in its care, all under a year old. The bear brought in this week is recovering and doing well, he said. The bear will be rehabilitated and will likely be released in the summer. Proper care early on can make all the difference in the outcome of an animal, he added.  ""What is the point of sedating a bear, driving it out here if it's just going to die because of the negligence?"" he said. ""There's no point. Might as well have just shot it.

When you see them in his photographs, there's usually something else at play, somewhere under the surface. That's evident in Wright's APEX: Interloper, the inaugural solo art exhibit at Corridor 45|75 in the Rideau LRT station. ""There's a way that I engage in photography that has to do more with the context, the circumstances ... the political and esthetic underpinnings of what's happening in a given place or with a given idea,"" said Wright, an associate professor of visual art at the University of Ottawa. ""I don't make pretty pictures."" It's not that he's against beauty — it's just that he knows it's never skin-deep, and wants to find out what's under the surface. ""I guess I'm more interested in why it's beautiful, how is it beautiful, or is it beautiful? Or what's really going on here? It's kind of like photography at the edges."" The 20-metre-long, 11-panel display is a panoramic shot of Apex, Nunavut, a settlement within Iqaluit that grew out of a former U.S. Air Force base.  Wright wants you to pay attention to the details and ask what else is at play in the scene, where sled dogs, oil barrels, radio towers an human habitations share space with ice, snow and sky. The title is a bit of a play on the idea of the ""apex predator,"" Wright said — something or someone at the top of the food chain. But the focus, according to Wright, is squarely on the beholder. Wright has enjoyed watching people's reaction to the work, and said a few have stopped to tell him it's like peering through a window into their own home. (Ottawa is home to the largest Inuit population outside Nunavut.)

It's been reported for weeks that the couple is interested in living in Canada at least part of the time and some British press are reporting that the couple is interested in buying a $36-million house on Point Grey Road in Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood.  So, in order to keep the speculation going over the couple and their son Archie, CBC News in Vancouver sent reporter Jon Hernandez to the property to ask residents what they think about the possibility of the royals moving in.  For the most part, the handful of people surveyed were supportive of the family living in Kits, but they all agreed it would change the makeup of the neighbourhood, which is known for its large properties and ocean views. Trina Littlejohns, who used to live in the UK, understands why the couple wants to try to live a quieter life after having to deal with the public spotlight and media in Britain. ""They're kind of in your face there,"" she said about the British press. ""I think it's great, they're good people and they want to sort of get away from the royal family-ish, so I think it's great."" Richard Roy isn't so sure though. His daily walk includes a stroll along Point Grey Road, where the house is. ""I don't know, I'm very conflicted because people should be able to do what they want,"" he said. ""From a selfish viewpoint, it will screw up our lives because this is a daily walking point and I don't think it will be quite the same anymore."" Roy said he would avoid the area if the royal couple moved in. ""There would probably be too much ruckus,"" he said. Max Lekhtman came down to see the house on Saturday with his dog Luna. He agreed that things around the home, such as added security, would probably change the neighbourhood, but he is supportive of the family being in Vancouver.

The CBC/Netflix drama series was not renewed for a fourth season in late November, and creator Moira Walley-Beckett has said on Instagram that ""there is just no way to revive"" it anywhere at this point. But viewers are still holding out hope the show can find a new life, and they're continuing their campaign to make that happen. Earlier this week, a viewer-created group that calls itself AWAE Fan Projects spent $1,000 on five digital ""Save 'Anne with an E'"" billboards in Toronto's downtown Yonge-Dundas Square. The campaign ran four days and featured fan-created artwork depicting the heroine from Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel Anne of Green Gables, which inspired the series. Now, they're hoping to get similar digital displays in New York's Times Square. ""A lot of us are willing to wait it out and see if anything happens,"" says Lisa Elksnitis, a senior financial administrator in Toronto who is part of the fan group and helped get the billboards. ""We understand it's not something that would happen overnight. Most people are going to keep trying for several months at least."" The third and final season of Anne with an E finished airing on the CBC in late November and hit Netflix on Jan. 3. Irish-Canadian actress Amybeth McNulty starred as the Prince Edward Island orphan, who is taken in by aging siblings, played by R.H. Thomson and Geraldine James. The series was shot in P.E.I. and Ontario and was a co-production between the CBC and Netflix. While the show was inspired by the novel, Walley-Beckett and co-executive producer Miranda de Pencier added new elements, including LGBTQ and Indigenous storylines. A post on Instagram this week showed Walley-Beckett visiting one Toronto billboard, which featured an image of Anne with a tear running down her cheek beside a list of words including ""racism,"" ""feminism"" and ""gender bias."" ""They have injected modern themes and storylines into this show but in a really successful way, and that's what kept me interested in it,"" says Elksnitis. The 37-year-old Elksnitis admits she didn't initially realize the show had such depth and didn't become a huge fan until after it was cancelled. Spurred by the online uproar, she binged it online and was blown away by the production value and acting. ""I just never got into it at the time, which annoys me, because if there are others like me then maybe there would have been more viewers back then,"" Elksnitis says. Elksnitis says the AWAE Fan Projects group has about 12 members who came together on social media and whom she hasn't met in person. They hail from countries including Canada, Germany, France, Portugal and the United States. The group started two GoFundMe campaigns — one to pay for social media advertising and another for billboards. Elksnitis is now working to get digital billboards in Times Square. She says the group also sent fan letters to the producer, Northwood Entertainment, and the CBC. Elksnitis knows of another fan group that plans to send white rags to TV studios — a nod to a season 3 episode in which some Green Gables residents wave white rags at a freedom-of-speech protest. There are also fan petitions calling on Netflix to renew the show. Elksnitis hopes any new Anne incarnation would have the same cast and creative team.

CARE Montreal partnered with CAP St-Barnabé to operate the shuttle service, which hit the streets last November for its third year. A driver patrols the city and offers rides to emergency shelters or to one of the warming stations CARE operates. But a week after it entered service, the window on the driver's side was shattered.  ""I was really, really upset when I saw it,"" said CARE director Michel Monette.  It cost the organization $3,000 to fix the damage. Monette also paid to install security cameras in the parking lot, hoping to deter future incidents. ""But then in January — boom!"" Someone had, once again, smashed one of the van's windows. Monette said that the rental company replaced the van, so service could continue, but the organization is on the hook for the repairs.  Between both incidents and the cost of the cameras, Monette said the vandalism has cost the initiative about 20 per cent of its operating budget for the season. Montreal police are investigating, but it's not clear if the two incidents are connected. Julie Vachon, who uses the shuttle to get to warming centres on cold nights, said she doesn't understand why someone would keep targeting the van. ""It's useful. We need it,"" she said. ""Those that aren't happy, they can just not look at the shuttle. It's idiotic."" ""It's sad and really frustrating,"" agreed Monette. ""We're offering a free service to help very marginalized people."" The centre will be going to the city and provincial governments to ask for additional funding to cover the cost of the repairs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/care-shuttle-vandal-1.5432044,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/vet-homeless-pets-in-montreal-1.4953459,[]
455,Anonymous,2020-01-20T22:50:06.241Z,Armed gun rights advocates protest in Virginia over Democratic legislation,"Thousands of gun rights activists from around the country rallied peacefully at the Virginia Capitol on Monday, protesting plans by the state's Democratic leadership to pass gun-control legislation — a move that has become a key flashpoint in the national debate over gun violence. The size of the crowd and the expected participation of white supremacists and fringe militia groups raised fears that the state could see a repeat of the violence that exploded in 2017 in Charlottesville. But the rally in Richmond concluded uneventfully around noon, and the mood was largely festive as attendees — many carrying military-style rifles — spilled into the streets, chanting ""USA!"" and waving signs denouncing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. ""I love this. This is like the Super Bowl for the Second Amendment right here,"" said P.J. Hudson, a truck driver from Richmond who carried an AR-15 rifle just outside Capitol Square. He was one of the few black rally-goers in the crowd that was overwhelmingly white and male, and frequently was stopped and asked to pose for pictures wearing his ""Black Guns Matter"" sweatshirt. An estimated 22,000 people attended, according to authorities, who said one woman was arrested on a felony charge of wearing a mask in public. The protesters came out despite the frigid temperature to send a message to legislators, they said. ""The government doesn't run us, we run the government,"" said Kem Regik, a 20-year-old private security officer from northern Virginia who brought a white flag with a picture of a rifle captioned, ""Come and take it."" Northam was a particular focus of the protesters'  wrath. One poster showed his face superimposed on Adolf Hitler's body. Many of the protesters wore camouflage. Some waved flags with messages of support for President Donald Trump. Trump weighed in Monday with support: ""The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights,"" he tweeted. ""This is just the beginning. Don't let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!"" But the state's Democratic lawmakers — including House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn and Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw —said the rally wasn't going to impact their plans to pass gun-control measures, including universal background checks and a one-handgun-purchase-a-month limit. Democrats say tightening Virginia's gun laws will make communities safer and help prevent mass shootings like the one last year in Virginia Beach, where a dozen people were killed in a municipal building. ""I was prepared to see a whole lot more people show up than actually did and I think it's an indication that a lot of this rhetoric is bluster, quite frankly,"" said Del. Chris Hurst, a gun-control advocate whose TV journalist girlfriend was killed in an on-air shooting in 2015. The Virginia State Police, the Virginia Capitol Police and the Richmond Police had a strong presence, with officers deploying on rooftops, others patrolling in cars and on bicycles. Authorities were looking to avoid a repeat of the violence that erupted in Charlottesville during one of the largest gatherings of white supremacists and other far-right groups in a decade. Attendees brawled with counter-protesters, and an avowed white supremacist drove his car into a crowd, killing a woman and injuring dozens more. Law enforcement officials faced scathing criticism for what both the white supremacist groups and anti-racism protesters said was a passive response. On Monday, Southern Poverty Law Center staff members attended the rally and identified members of militia groups, including the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, as well as the League of the South, according to outreach director Lecia Brooks. The League of the South, which the centre designates a hate group, advocates for Southern secession. In contrast to Charlottesville, there was little sign of any counter-protesters challenging the gun rights activists. Police limited access to Capitol Square to only one entrance, and a long line formed to get into the rally zone. Demonstrators also filled the hallways of the building that houses lawmakers' offices. One couple, Jared and Marie March, travelled from Floyd County, over three hours west of Richmond, to meet with lawmakers. ""Guns are a way of life where we live,"" said Marie March, who was concerned about a proposed red-flag law she said would allow citizens to be stripped of their guns due to ""subjective criteria."" A proposal to establish universal background checks amounted to ""more Big Brother,"" she said. ""We just feel like we need to push government back into their rightful spot."" Monday's rally was organized by an influential grassroots gun rights group, the Virginia Citizens Defense League. The group holds a yearly Lobby Day rally at the capitol on Martin Luther King Day, typically a low-key event with a few hundred gun enthusiasts listening to speeches from a handful of ambitious Republican lawmakers. But this year's event was unprecedented. Second Amendment groups have identified the state as a rallying point for the fight against what they see as a national erosion of gun rights. The pushback against proposed new gun restrictions began immediately after Democrats won majorities in both the state senate and House of Delegates in November, with much of the opposition focused on a proposed assault weapons ban. More than 100 localities have since passed measures declaring support for the Second Amendment. Erich Pratt, senior vice-president of Gun Owners of America, said voters need to replace the Democrats in control of the government in Virginia. ""We need to throw the bums out. We need to clean house in the next election,"" he told the crowd. House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert complimented the behaviour of the rally-goers and said Democrats should take a lesson from them. ""The law-abiding gun owners in attendance today are the ones who would bear the brunt of their anti-gun proposals, which would have little to no impact on crime or criminals,"" he said in a statement. The rally coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, which is typically a chance for everyday citizens to use a day off work to lobby their legislators. However, the threat of violence largely kept other groups away from the capitol, including gun control groups that hold an annual vigil for victims of gun violence. When that event was cancelled, students from March for Our Lives, the movement launched after 17 were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in 2018, decided they had to do something. A group of about 15 college students and one high schooler slept overnight in the offices of two Democratic lawmakers to ensure they could make it into the capitol area safely. The lawmakers, Hurst and Del. Dan Helmer — who is sponsoring a bill that would block the National Rifle Association from operating an indoor gun range at its headquarters — camped out as well. Michael McCabe, a 17-year-old high school senior from northern Virginia, said he was there to underscore the ""moral urgency"" felt by a generation ""unduly affected"" by gun violence. ""Our main goal is not to engage with gun extremists today,"" McCabe said. ""We are really here to be present in the legislature to make our voices heard.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/virginia-gun-rights-rally-1.5432969,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/james-fields-heather-heyer-charlottesville-sentence-1.5211830 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nra-walmart-1.5269970 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fbi-arrests-the-base-georgia-wisconsin-1.5432006 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/militias-oath-keepers-rallies-1.4246317,/news/world/kentucky-virginia-us-1.5349460
