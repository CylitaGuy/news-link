# News-Link: Saving Journalists Time for What Matters

Website: http://cguy.pythonanywhere.com/

## The Problem:

Large digital news publishers, like many online services, want to increase audience engagement with their content. While there are a variety of strategies that these publishers may use to accomplish this, one approach commonly employed is to insert links that direct readers to additional, related news stories on that publisher's website. While these links serve to increase the time readers spend interacting with a digital publisher's news content, currently these links are often curated manually by journalists. As a result journalists may spend a significant portion of their day searching for related stories to include in a story they are working on. Where these links are generated automatically, it is often based on popularity. This can be frustrating for the reader who, as a result, may be provided with links to stories that - although popular in their area - are completely unrelated to an article they are reading.

## The Solution:

**News-Link** is web application that uses natural language processing to quickly recommend journalists links to stories that are similar in content to the one they are writing. Ultimately, by automating the process of searching for similar news stories, **News-Link** saves journalists time. Importantly, by using NLP it also ensures that recommended articles are similar to a story of interest - reducing frustration on the part of the user when compare to recommendation systems based solely on popularity.

## Setting up News-Link
