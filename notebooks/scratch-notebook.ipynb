      "Rania Khunaysir didnt see it coming when she booked a lastminute Caribbean vacation for her young family The Toronto parent had no idea the airplane cabin would be fumigated with them on board just before they landed in Jamaica despite guidelines that say passengers should be clearly and repeatedly informed of the requirement before they fly  Suddenly there was an announcement on the intercom saying that [flight attendants will] be walking down the aisle spraying a nontoxic insecticide  I thought insecticide doesnt sound nontoxic Khunaysir told Go Public about the familys flight last August Khunaysirs husband Randy Beharry and their threeyearold daughter are both asthmatic The couples son who was seven months old at the time was also on the flight I was worried about my kids Beharry said My asthma triggered probably within minutes I had a hard time breathing The experience left the family concerned about potential health impacts of the spray and calling for strict rules that require passengers to be clearly informed before they fly I dont want to be inhaling this pesticide Khunaysir said  More than two dozen countries such as Jamaica the Dominican Republic and Mexico require airlines to spray insecticides on flights that arrive from Canada The process is meant to kill insects that could spread disease The World Health Organization has said it has found no evidence the sprays used are harmful to human health when they are used as recommended but also says nonchemical methods need to be found   The longstanding practice is raising concerns among some health experts There is no such thing as a nontoxic pesticide said researcher Chris van Netten a professor emeritus with the University of British Columbias school of population and public health He calls the widespread system of spraying pesticides not acceptable and said airline crew members and passengers need to be better informed and protected  especially children older travellers and those with respiratory problems  Frequent traveller Josie Ball from Selkirk Ont flies to Cuba several times a year with Sunwing and said she was shocked the first time she was on a flight where the cabin was sprayed  She said people on her flight in April 2018 were coughing and wheezing  I think the public should have been aware  that there is a spraying in these countries  and [told] a little bit more about the chemical theyre spraying she said She now takes her own mask when shes travelling to hotter countries  Harlene Hart from Newington southeast of Ottawa was on her way to Cuba on another Sunwing flight in February a birthday present from her boyfriend when the cabin was sprayed with pesticide about an hour before they landed  Insecticide should be sprayed in a wellventilated area she told Go Public in an email Not a sardine can with partially reused air What upsets her most she said is that she wasnt clearly notified before she purchased her ticket She said she wouldnt have taken the trip if she had known Canadian airlines are not obligated to let passengers know before they fly that the cabin will be sprayed with insecticide  despite studies cited by health experts Go Public spoke with who say the spraying can cause serious asthma attacks skin irritations and longterm problems with the nervous system Transport Canada said theres nothing it can do but the transportation authority does acknowledge the practice could pose a foreseeable hazard  The video below was posted by YouTube user ScottTheCoffeeGeek It is unverified but appears to show a flight attendant on a China Eastern flight carrying out the topofdescent disinsection procedure which involves spraying while passengers are on board  Go Public found an advisory issued in 2009 where the department said passengers with respiratory issues need to be clearly informed before they fly so they can get advice from their own physician  on whether they should travel to those destinations That advisory sets guidelines  not rules  saying airlines should notify passengers  Before they purchase their tickets  On the flight ticket itself  Before boarding the aircraft None of the four Canadian airlines that travel to these destinations informs passengers using all three methods  WestJet points out that disinsection is only required on four of the 20 countries it flies to and two other airlines that fly to these countries  Sunwing and Air Transat  say they are complying with guidelines by putting the information on their websites and telling passengers who ask Air Canada also requires passengers booking online to click on a box agreeing to the airlines General Conditions of Carriage Halfway through that document there is information about the spraying being carried out on certain routes  The airline also mentions aircraft disinfection on its Health Tips section of the website and provides a link to that section on the itinerary emailed to passengers who book directly with Air Canada  However passengers wont see that link if they book through third party websites like Khunaysir did when she booked her Air Canada flight Van Netten who has studied the effects of repeated exposure to pesticides said the message that insecticide will be used in plane cabins isnt getting through He said airlines and Transport Canada can do better People have a right to know what they are going to be exposed to  The practice of fumigating an airplanes cabin started decades ago Its mandated by governments outside Canada and considered necessary to control potentially deadly diseases that can be transmitted via insects  such as malaria and yellow fever  before entering certain tropical countries  Twentyseven countries require Canadian airlines to spray Two methods are used according to the Transport Canada website spraying aerosol insecticides in the cabin while passengers are onboard and treating the airplanes interior surfaces before passengers board Both of them have their problems van Netten said  He said the second method leaves toxic residue on surfaces travellers eat and sleep on noting recent studies have drawn a link between both methods of spraying and effects on the nervous system Tingling in the fingers for instance  thats how it would start And it can go all the way up to a neurological impairment  but that takes a lot of exposure to get to that stage The spray often contains an insecticide called Permethrin a pesticide thats been approved by the World Health Organization for whats called disinsection on flights  The union representing flight attendants in Canada is also worried about the spraying  We get reports of a sore throat sore eyes  lots of skin conditions said Troy Winters senior health and safety officer for the Canadian Union of Public Employees Ive got a recent report about skin peeling off of the inside of somebodys hand and we had one fairly serious asthma reaction   Hes concerned about the longterm effects of repeated exposure on airline staff saying some can be exposed to the spray more than 100 times during their career Recently Ive started to see some reports of potential longerterm results and Im concerned about potential longterm neurological effects  There are no industrywide rules on what if any protective gear flight attendants wear while fumigating  All the airlines say they provide training and safety equipment to staff Winters would like to see the Canadian government put pressure on the destination countries to reduce the use suggesting a review of whether a flight leaving Canada in the dead of winter really needs to be fumigated  The US has a law that requires airlines to disclose disinsection on their website and refer travellers to the specific section when they buy a ticket  The Federal Aviation Administrations Reauthorization Act also recommends the US government work with WHO to find a safe effective and nontoxic means of preventing the transportation of diseasecarrying mosquitoes and other insects on commercial aircraft There are nonspraying methods being developed like a mechanical air curtain that blows everything out in one direction but they are still in the testing stages  WHO says the chemicals used pose no risk to human health when used properly but when it reviewed current disinsection practices in 2018 it said there is a need for new nonchemical methods For now travellers have few options  such as choosing to travel to countries that dont require spraying travelling with a mask to put on before the spraying starts and being sure to wipe down all surfaces on the plane when passengers settle in Khunaysir and Beharry say given the age of their children and asthma issues they would have chosen another destination if they were told ahead of them that theyd be sprayed  Im really surprised that they allow this to continue Khunaysir said I wouldve had no problem saying Lets change our destination lets go somewhere else where they dont require that  Submit
